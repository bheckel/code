<H2>CHAPTER 1: What is a pointer? </H2>
<P>
One of those things beginners in C find difficult is the concept
of pointers. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an introduction
to pointers and their use to these beginners. 
<P>
I have found that often the main reason beginners have a problem
with pointers is that they have a weak or minimal feeling for
variables, (as they are used in C). Thus we start with a discussion
of C variables in general. 
<P>
A variable in a program is something with a name, the value of
which can vary. The way the compiler and linker handles this is
that it assigns a specific block of memory within the computer
to hold the value of that variable. The size of that block depends
on the range over which the variable is allowed to vary. For example,
on PC's the size of an integer variable is 2 bytes, and that of
a long integer is 4 bytes. In C the size of a variable type such
as an integer need not be the same on all types of machines.
<P>
When we declare a variable we inform the compiler of two things,
the name of the variable and the type of the variable. For example,
we declare a variable of type integer with the name<B> k</B> by
writing: 
<PRE>
    int k; 
</PRE>
<P>
On seeing the &quot;int&quot; part of this statement the compiler
sets aside 2 bytes of memory (on a PC) to hold the value of the
integer. It also sets up a symbol table. In that table it adds
the symbol<B> k</B> and the relative address in memory where those
2 bytes were set aside. 
<P>
Thus, later if we write: 
<PRE>
    k = 2; 
</PRE>
<P>
we expect that, at run time when this statement is executed, the
value 2 will be placed in that memory location reserved for the
storage of the value of <B>k</B>. In C we refer to a variable
such as the integer <B>k</B> as an &quot;object&quot;.
<P>
In a sense there are two &quot;values&quot; associated with the
object <B>k</B>. One is the value of the integer stored there
(2 in the above example) and the other the &quot;value&quot; of
the memory location, i.e., the address of <B>k</B>. Some texts
refer to these two values with the nomenclature <I><B>rvalue</B></I>
(right value, pronounced &quot;are value&quot;) and<I><B> lvalue</B></I>
(left value, pronounced &quot;el value&quot;) respectively. 
<P>
In some languages, the lvalue is the value permitted on the left
side of the assignment operator '=' (i.e. the address where the
result of evaluation of the right side ends up). The rvalue is
that which is on the right side of the assignment statement, the
<B>2</B> above. Rvalues cannot be used on the left side of the
assignment statement. Thus: <B>2 = k</B>; is illegal. 
<P>
Actually, the above definition of &quot;lvalue&quot; is somewhat
modified for C. According to K&amp;R II (page 197): [1] 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;An <I><B>object</B></I> is a named region of storage; an
<I><B>lvalue</B></I> is an expression referring to an object.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
However, at this point, the definition originally cited above
is sufficient. As we become more familiar with pointers we will
go into more detail on this. 
<P>
Okay, now consider: 
<PRE>
   int j, k; 

    k = 2; 
    j = 7;    &lt;-- line 1 
    k = j;    &lt;-- line 2 
</PRE>
<P>
In the above, the compiler interprets the <B>j</B> in line 1 as
the address of the variable <B>j</B> (its lvalue) and creates
code to copy the value 7 to that address. In line 2, however,
the <B>j</B> is interpreted as its rvalue (since it is on the
right hand side of the assignment operator '='). That is, here
the <B>j</B> refers to the value <I><B>stored</B></I> at the memory
location set aside for <B>j</B>, in this case 7. So, the 7 is
copied to the address designated by the lvalue of<B> k</B>. 
<P>
In all of these examples, we are using 2 byte integers so all
copying of rvalues from one storage location to the other is done
by copying 2 bytes. Had we been using long integers, we would
be copying 4 bytes. 
<P>
Now, let's say that we have a reason for wanting a variable designed
to hold an lvalue (an address). The size required to hold such
a value depends on the system. On older desk top computers with
64K of memory total, the address of any point in memory can be
contained in 2 bytes. Computers with more memory would require
more bytes to hold an address. Some computers, such as the IBM
PC might require special handling to hold a segment and offset
under certain circumstances. The actual size required is not too
important so long as we have a way of informing the compiler that
what we want to store is an address. 
<P>
Such a variable is called a <I><B>pointer variable</B></I> (for
reasons which hopefully will become clearer a little later). In
C when we define a pointer variable we do so by preceding its
name with an asterisk. In C we also give our pointer a type which,
in this case, refers to the type of data stored at the address
we will be storing in our pointer. For example, consider the variable
declaration: 
<PRE>
   int *ptr;
</PRE>
<P>
<B>ptr</B> is the name of our variable (just as <B>k</B> was the
name of our integer variable). The '*' informs the compiler that
we want a pointer variable, i.e. to set aside however many bytes
is required to store an address in memory. The <B>int</B> says
that we intend to use our pointer variable to store the address
of an integer. Such a pointer is said to &quot;point to&quot;
an integer. However, note that when we wrote <B>int k;</B> we
did not give <B>k</B> a value. If this definition is made outside
of any function ANSI compliant compilers will initialize it to
zero. Similarly, <B>ptr</B> has no value, that is we haven't stored
an address in it in the above declaration. In this case, again
if the declaration is outside of any function, it is initialized
to a value guaranteed in such a way that it is guaranteed to not
point to any C object or function. A pointer initialized in this
manner is called a &quot;null&quot; pointer. 
<P>
The actual bit pattern used for a null pointer may or may not
evaluate to zero since it depends on the specific system on which
the code is developed. To make the source code compatible between
various compilers on various systems, a macro is used to represent
a null pointer. That macro goes under the name NULL. Thus, setting
the value of a pointer using the NULL macro, as with an assignment
statement such as ptr = NULL, guarantees that the pointer has
become a null pointer. Similarly, just as one can test for an
integer value of zero, as in <B>if(k == 0)</B>, we can test for
a null pointer using <B>if (ptr == NULL)</B>. 
<P>
But, back to using our new variable<B> ptr</B>. Suppose now that
we want to store in <B>ptr</B> the address of our integer variable
<B>k</B>. To do this we use the unary <B>&amp;</B> operator and
write: 
<PRE>
    ptr = &amp;k; 
</PRE>
<P>
What the <B>&amp;</B> operator does is retrieve the lvalue (address)
of <B>k</B>, even though <B>k</B> is on the right hand side of
the assignment operator '=', and copies that to the contents of
our pointer ptr. Now, ptr is said to &quot;point to&quot; <B>k</B>.
Bear with us now, there is only one more operator we need to discuss.
<P>
The &quot;dereferencing operator&quot; is the asterisk and it
is used as follows: 
<PRE>
    *ptr = 7; 
</PRE>
<P>
will copy 7 to the address pointed to by <B>ptr</B>. Thus if <B>ptr</B>
&quot;points to&quot; (contains the address of) <B>k</B>, the
above statement will set the value of <B>k</B> to 7. That is,
when we use the '*' this way we are referring to the value of
that which ptr is pointing to, not the value of the pointer itself.
<P>
Similarly, we could write: 
<PRE>
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,*ptr); 
</PRE>
<P>
to print to the screen the integer value stored at the address
pointed to by <B>ptr</B>;. 
<P>
One way to see how all this stuff fits together would be to run
the following program and then review the code and the output
carefully. 
<PRE>
------------ Program 1.1 --------------------------------- 

/* Program 1.1 from PTRTUT10.TXT   6/10/97 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int j, k;
int *ptr;

int main(void)
{
    j = 1;
    k = 2;
    ptr = &amp;k;
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
    printf(&quot;j has the value %d and is stored at %p\n&quot;, j, (void *)&amp;j);
    printf(&quot;k has the value %d and is stored at %p\n&quot;, k, (void *)&amp;k);
    printf(&quot;ptr has the value %p and is stored at %p\n&quot;, ptr, (void *)&amp;ptr);
    printf(&quot;The value of the integer pointed to by ptr is %d\n&quot;, *ptr);

    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Note: We have yet to discuss those aspects of C which require
the use of the <B>(void *)</B> expression used here. For now,
include it in your test code. We'll explain the reason behind
this expression later.

<P>
To review: 
<UL>
<LI>A variable is declared by giving it a type and a name (e.g.
<B>int k;</B>) 
<LI>A pointer variable is declared by giving it a type and a name
(e.g. <B>int *ptr</B>) where the asterisk tells the compiler that
the variable named <B>ptr</B> is a pointer variable and the type
tells the compiler what type the pointer is to point to (integer
in this case). 
<LI>Once a variable is declared, we can get its address by preceding
its name with the unary<B> &amp;</B> operator, as in <B>&amp;k</B>.
<LI>We can &quot;dereference&quot; a pointer, i.e. refer to the
value of that which it points to, by using the unary '*' operator
as in <B>*ptr</B>. 
<LI>An &quot;lvalue&quot; of a variable is the value of its address,
i.e. where it is stored in memory. The &quot;rvalue&quot; of a
variable is the value stored in that variable (at that address).
