A quick macro to delete Excel rows

Often, you'll want to delete entire rows in Excel spreadsheets if one or
more key cells are blank. To accomplish this, create a loop that iterates
through the Cells collection in the column or range you want to check for
blank values. Then, use the Row property to delete the entire row. For
example, if you want to delete rows that have empty cells in column D, use
the following macro

For Each cell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Columns(4).Cells
     If IsEmpty(cell) Then
          Rows(cell.Row).Delete
     End If
Next cell
