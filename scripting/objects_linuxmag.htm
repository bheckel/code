<BLOCKQUOTE>

 <P CLASS ="LEADPARA">In the past three columns, I looked at using "references" in Perl. References are an important part of capturing and reflecting the structure of real-world data -- for example, a table of employees, each of whom has various attributes, can be represented as an array of hashrefs, pointing at attribute hashes for each employee.</P>

 <P>Now let's turn to capturing and reflecting real-world processes, in the form of "objects." Objects provide encapsulation (to control access to data), abstract data types (to let the data more closely model the real world), and inheritance (to reuse operations that are similar but have some variation).</P>

 <P>The Perl distribution includes <I>perlobj,</I> a basic reference in using objects, and <I>perltoot,</I> which introduces readers to the peculiarities of Perl's object system in a tutorial way. However, I found that both of these documentation sections tend to be opaque to those of us with less experience with objects. And that seems to be the majority of users coming from a system-administration or CGI Web-development background (Perl's core audience).</P>

 <P>So I created some courseware for my company's Perl training classes that took a different approach, presuming no prior exposure to objects. It goes something like this...</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>If We Could Talk to the Animals...</B></P>


 <P>Let's let the animals talk for a moment:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>sub Cow::speak {
print "a Cow goes moooo!\n";
}
sub Horse::speak {
print "a Horse goes neigh!\n";
}
sub Sheep::speak {
print "a Sheep goes baaaah!\n"
}
Cow::speak;
Horse::speak;
Sheep::speak;
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>This results in:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>a Cow goes moooo!
a Horse goes neigh!
a Sheep goes baaaah!
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Nothing spectacular here. Simple subroutines, albeit from separate packages, and called using the full package name. So let's fill an entire pasture:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># Cow::speak, Horse::speak, Sheep::speak as before
@pasture = qw(Cow Cow Horse Sheep Sheep);
foreach $animal (@pasture) {
&{$animal."::speak"};
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>This results in:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>a Cow goes moooo!
a Cow goes moooo!
a Horse goes neigh!
a Sheep goes baaaah!
a Sheep goes baaaah!
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Wow. That symbolic coderef de-referencing there is pretty nasty. We're counting on <I>no strict subs</I> mode, certainly not recommended for larger programs. And why was that necessary? Because the name of the package seems to be inseparable from the name of the subroutine we want to invoke within that package.</P>

 <P>Or is it?</P>

<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Introducing the Method-invocation Arrow</B></P>


 <P>For the moment, let's say that <I>Class->method</I> invokes subroutine <I>method</I> in package <I>Class.</I> That's not completely accurate, but we'll do this one step at a time. Now let's use it like so:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># Cow::speak, Horse::speak, Sheep::speak as before
Cow->speak;
Horse->speak;
Sheep->speak;
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>And once again, this results in:</P>

<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>a Cow goes moooo!
a Horse goes neigh!
a Sheep goes baaaah!
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>That's not fun yet. Same number of characters, all constant, no variables. But, the parts are separable now. Watch:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>$a = "Cow";
$a->speak; # invokes Cow->speak
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Ahh! Now that the package name has been parted from the subroutine name, we can use a variable package name. And this time, we've got something that works even when <I>use strict refs</I> is enabled.</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Invoking a Barnyard</B></P>


 <P>Let's take that new arrow invocation and put it back in the barnyard example:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>sub Cow::speak {
print "a Cow goes moooo!\n";
}
sub Horse::speak {
print "a Horse goes neigh!\n";
}
sub Sheep::speak {
print "a Sheep goes baaaah!\n"
}
@pasture = qw(Cow Cow Horse Sheep Sheep);
foreach $animal (@pasture) {
$animal->speak;
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>There! Now we have the animals all talking, and safely at that, without the use of symbolic coderefs.</P>

 <P>But look at all that common code. Each of the <TT>speak</TT> routines has a similar structure: a <TT>print</TT> operator and a string that contains common text, except for two of the words. It would be nice if we could factor out the commonality, in case we decide later to change it all to <TT>says</TT> instead of <TT>goes.</TT></P>

 <P>And we actually have a way of doing that without much fuss, but first we have to hear a bit more about what the method-invocation arrow is actually doing for us.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>The Extra Parameter of Method Invocation</B></P>


 <P>The invocation of:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>Class->method(@args)
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>attempts to invoke subroutine <I>Class::method</I> as:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>Class::method("Class", @args);
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>(If the subroutine can't be found, "inheritance" kicks in, but we'll get to that later.) This means that we get the class name as the first parameter. So we can rewrite the <I>Sheep</I> speaking subroutine as:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>sub Sheep::speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes baaaah!\n";
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>And the other two animals come out similarly:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>sub Cow::speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes moooo!\n";
}
sub Horse::speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes neigh!\n";
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>In each case, <TT>$class</TT> will get the value appropriate for that subroutine. But once again, we have a lot of similar structure. Can we factor that out even further? Yes, by calling another method in the same class.</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Calling a Second Method to Simplify Things</B></P>


 <P>Let's call out from <I>speak</I> to a helper method called <I>sound. </I>This method provides the constant text for the sound itself.</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>{ package Cow;
sub sound { "moooo" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes ", $class->sound,
"!\n"
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Now, when we call <I>Cow->speak,</I> we get a <I>$class</I> of <I>Cow</I> in <I>speak.</I> This in turn selects the <I>Cow->sound</I> method, which returns <TT>moooo</TT>. But how different would this be for the <I>Horse?</I></P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>{ package Horse;
sub sound { "neigh" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes ", $class->sound,
"!\n"
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>The only differences are the name of the package and the specific sound. So can we somehow share the definition for <I>speak</I> between the <I>Cow</I> and the <I>Horse?</I> Yes, with inheritance!</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Inheriting the Windpipes</B></P>


 <P>We'll define a common subroutine package called <I>Animal,</I> with the definition for <I>speak:</I></P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>{ package Animal;
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes ", $class->sound,
"!\n"
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Then, for each animal, we say it "inherits" from <I>Animal,</I> along with the animal-specific sound:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>{ package Cow;
@ISA = qw(Animal);
sub sound { "moooo" }
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Note the added <TT>@ISA</TT> array. We'll get to that in a minute.</P>

 <P>But what happens when we invoke <I>Cow->speak</I> now?</P>

 <P>First, Perl constructs the argument list. In this case, it's just <I>Cow. </I>Then Perl looks for <I>Cow::speak.</I> But that's not there, so Perl checks for the inheritance array <I>@Cow::ISA. </I>It's there and contains the single name <I>Animal.</I></P>

 <P>Perl next checks for <I>speak</I> inside <I>Animal</I> instead, as in <I>Animal::speak.</I> And that's found, so Perl invokes that subroutine with the already frozen argument list.</P>

 <P>Inside the <I>Animal::speak</I> subroutine, <I>$class</I> becomes <I>Cow</I> (the first argument). So when we get to the step of invoking <I>$class->sound,</I> it'll be looking for <I>Cow->sound</I>, which gets it on the first try without looking at <I>@ISA. </I>Success!</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>A Few Notes about @ISA</B></P>


 <P>This magical <I>@ISA</I> variable (pronounced "is a" not "ice-uh"), has declared that <I>Cow</I> "is a" <I>Animal.</I> Note that it's an array, not a simple single value, because on rare occasions it makes sense to have more than one parent class searched for the missing methods.</P>

 <P>If <I>Animal</I> also had an <I>@ISA,</I> then we'd check there too. The search is recursive, depth-first, left-to-right in each <I>@ISA.</I></P>

 <P>When we turn on <I>use strict,</I> we'll get complaints on <I>@ISA,</I> since it's not a variable containing an explicit package name, nor is it a lexical ("my") variable. We can't make it a lexical variable though, so there are a couple of straightforward ways to handle these complaints.</P>

 <P>The easiest is to just spell the package name out:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>@Cow::ISA = qw(Animal);
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Or allow it as an implicitly named package variable:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>package Cow;
use vars qw(@ISA);
@ISA = qw(Animal);
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>If you're bringing in the class from outside, via an object-oriented module, you change:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>package Cow;
use Animal;
use vars qw(@ISA);
@ISA = qw(Animal);

into just:

package Cow;
use base qw(Animal);
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>And that's pretty darn compact. If you're interested in learning how to create a proper module yourself, you can go to this useful page: <a href="http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/perl/module_mechanics.html">http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/perl/module_mechanics.html</a>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Overriding the Methods</B></P>


 <P>Let's add a mouse, which can barely be heard:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># Animal package from before
{ package Mouse;
@ISA = qw(Animal);
sub sound { "squeak" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
print "a $class goes ", $class->sound,
"!\n";
print "[but you can barely hear it!]\n";
}
}
Mouse->speak;
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>which results in:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>a Mouse goes squeak!
[but you can barely hear it!]
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Here, <I>Mouse</I> has its own speaking routine, so that <TT>Mouse->speak</TT> doesn't immediately invoke <I>Animal-> speak.</I> This is known as "overriding." In fact, we didn't even need to say that a <I>Mouse</I> was an <I>Animal</I> at all, since all of the methods needed for <I>speak</I> are completely defined with <I>Mouse.</I></P>

 <P>But we've now duplicated some of the code from <I>Animal->speak,</I> and this can once again be a maintenance headache. So, can we avoid that? Can we say somehow that a <I>Mouse</I> does everything any other <I>Animal</I> does, but add in the extra comment? Sure!</P>

 <P>First, we can invoke the <I>Animal::speak</I> method directly:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># Animal package from before
{ package Mouse;
@ISA = qw(Animal);
sub sound { "squeak" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
Animal::speak($class);
print "[but you can barely hear it!]\n";
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Note that we have to include the <TT>$class</TT> parameter (which will be <I>Mouse,</I> or possibly the name of a subclass of <I>Mouse</I>) as the first parameter to <TT>Animal::speak</TT>, since we've stopped using the method arrow. Why did we stop? Well, if we invoke <I>Animal->speak</I> there, the first parameter to the method will be <I>Animal</I> not <I>Mouse,</I> and when time comes for it to call for the <I>sound,</I> it won't have the right class to come back to this package.</P>

 <P>Invoking <I>Animal::speak</I> directly is a mess, however. What if <I>Animal::speak</I> didn't exist before, and was being inherited from a class mentioned in <I>@Animal::ISA? </I>Because we are no longer using the method arrow, we get one and only one chance to hit the right subroutine.</P>

 <P>Also note that the <I>Animal</I> classname is now hardwired into the subroutine selection. This is a mess if someone maintains the code, changing <TT>@ISA</TT> for <TT>Mouse</TT>, and didn't notice <TT>Animal</TT> there in <TT>speak</TT>. So, this is probably not the right way to go.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>Starting the Search from a Different Place</B></P>


 <P>A better solution is to tell Perl to search from a higher place in the inheritance chain:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># same Animal as before
{ package Mouse;
@ISA = qw(Animal);
sub sound { "squeak" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
$class->Animal::speak;
print "[but you can barely hear it!]\n";
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>Ahh. This works. Using this syntax, we start with <I>Animal</I> to find <I>speak,</I> and use all of <I>Animal'</I>s inheritance chain if it's not found immediately. And yet the first parameter will be <I>$class,</I> so the found <I>speak</I> method will get <I>Mouse</I> as its first entry, and eventually work its way back to <I>Mouse::sound</I> for the details.</P>

 <P>But this isn't the best solution. We still have to keep the <I>@ISA</I> and the initial search package coordinated. Worse, if <I>Mouse</I> had multiple entries in <I>@ISA,</I> we wouldn't necessarily know which one had actually defined <I>speak.</I> So, is there an even better way?</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>The SUPER Way of Doing Things</B></P>


 <P>By simply changing the <I>Animal</I> class to the <I>SUPER</I> class in that invocation, we get a search of all of our super classes automatically:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE># same Animal as before
{ package Mouse;
@ISA = qw(Animal);
sub sound { "squeak" }
sub speak {
my $class = shift;
$class->SUPER::speak;
print "[but you can barely hear it!]\n";
}
}
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>So, <I>SUPER::speak</I> means look in the current package's <I>@ISA</I> for <I>speak,</I> invoking the first one found.</P>


<P CLASS ="SUBHEAD"><B>In Summary</B></P>


 <P>So far, I've introduced a method arrow syntax:</P>


<DIV CLASS ="LISTING"><P>
<PRE>Class->method(@args);
or the equivalent:
$a = "Class";
$a->method(@args);

which constructs an argument list of:

("Class", @args)
and attempts to invoke
Class::method("Class", @Args);
</PRE></P></DIV>

 <P>However, if <I>Class::method</I> is not found, then <I>@Class::ISA</I> is examined (recursively) to locate a package that does indeed contain <I>method,</I> and that subroutine is invoked instead.</P>

 <P>Using this simple syntax, we have class methods, (multiple) inheritance, overriding, and extending. Using just what we've seen so far, we've been able to factor out common code and provide a nice way to reuse implementations with variations. This is at the core of what objects provide, but objects also provide instance data, which we haven't even begun to cover.</P>

 <P>But it seems that I've run out of space for this time, so see Part Two of our "Object Lesson" in next month's issue. Until then, enjoy.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P class=LEADPARA>Last month's column was a brief tutorial introducing 
        the concept of objects in Perl. We covered some of the basic concepts of 
        object-oriented programming, including class methods and inheritance. We 
        learned how to factor out and reuse common code with variations. This 
        month we'll learn how to create instance data, which is information 
        associated with one particular object.</P>
        <P>As you may recall, I introduced the method-arrow syntax 
        <I>Class-&gt;method(@args);</I> or the equivalent:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>$a = "Class";
$a-&gt;method(@args);
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>which constructs an argument list of <I>("Class", @args)</I>and 
        attempts to invoke:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>Class::method("Class", @args);
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>However, if <I>Class::method</I> is not found, then 
        <I>@Class::ISA</I> is examined (recursively) to locate a package that 
        does indeed contain <I>method,</I> and that subroutine is invoked 
        instead.</P>
        <P>Using this simple syntax, we have class methods, (multiple) 
        inheritance, overriding, and extending. Using just what we've seen so 
        far, we've been able to factor out common code and provide a nice way to 
        reuse implementations with variations. This is at the core of what 
        objects provide, but objects also provide instance data, which we will 
        discuss now.</P>
        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>A Horse Is a Horse, of Course of Course -- Or Is 
        It?</B></P>
        <P>Let's start with the code from last month for the <I>Animal</I> class 
        and the <I>Horse </I>class:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>{ package Animal;
   sub speak {
      my $class = shift;
      print "a $class goes ", $class-&gt; 
         sound, "!\n"
   }
}
{ package Horse;
   @ISA = qw(Animal);
   sub sound { "neigh" }
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>This lets us invoke <I>Horse-&gt;speak</I> to ripple upward to 
        <I>Animal::speak,</I> calling back to <I>Horse::sound</I> to get the 
        specific sound, and the output of:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>a Horse goes neigh!
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>But all of our <I>Horse</I> objects would have to be absolutely 
        identical. If I add a subroutine, all horses automatically share it. 
        That's great for making horses the same, but how do we capture the 
        distinctions about an individual horse? For example, suppose I want to 
        give my first horse a name. There's got to be a way to keep its name 
        separate from the other horses.</P>
        <P>We can do that by drawing a new distinction, called an "instance." An 
        "instance" is generally created by a class. In Perl, any reference can

my $talking = \$name;
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>So now <TT>$talking</TT> is a reference to what will be the 
        instance-specific data (the name). The final step in turning this into a 
        real instance is with a special operator called <I>bless:</I></P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>bless $talking, Horse;
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>This operator stores information about the package named <I>Horse</I> 
        into the thing pointed at by the reference. At this point, we say 
        <I>$talking</I> is an instance of <I>Horse. </I>That is, it's a specific 
        horse. The reference is otherwise unchanged and can still be used with 
        traditional dereferencing operators.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR

        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>Invoking an Instance Method</B></P>
        <P>The method arrow can be used on instances as well as names of 
        packages (classes). So, let's get the sound that <I>$talking</I> 
        makes:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>my $noise = $talking-&gt;sound;
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>To invoke <I>sound,</I> Perl first notes that <TT>$talking</TT> is a 
        blessed reference (and thus an instance). It then constructs an argument 
        list, in this case from just <TT>($talking)</TT>. (Later we'll see that 
        arguments will take their place following the instance variable, just as 
        with classes.)</P>
        <P>Now for the fun part: Perl takes the class in which the instance was 
        blessed, in this case <I>Horse, </I>and uses that to locate the 
        subroutine to invoke the method. In this case, <I>Horse::sound</I> is 
        found directly (without using inheritance), yielding the final 
        subroutine invocation:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>Horse::sound($talking)
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Note that the first parameter here is still the instance, not the 
        name of the class. We'll get <TT>neigh</TT> as the return value, and 
        that'll end up as the <TT>$noise</TT> variable above.</P>
        <P>If <I>Horse::sound</I> had not been found, we'd be wandering up the 
        <I>@Horse::ISA</I> list to find the method in one of the superclasses, 
        just as for a class method. The only difference between a class method 
        and an instance method is that the first parameter will be a class name 
        (a string) or an instance (a blessed reference) respectively.</P>
        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>Accessing the Instance Data</B></P>
        <P>Because we get the instance as the first parameter, we can now access 
        the instance-specific data. In this case, let's add a way to get at the 
        name:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>{ package Horse;
   @ISA = qw(Animal);
   sub sound { "neigh" }
   sub name {
      my $self = shift;
      $$self;
   }
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Now we call for the name:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>print $talking-&gt;name, " says ", 
   $talking-&gt;sound, "\n";
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Inside <I>Horse::name, </I>the <TT>@_</TT> array contains just 
        <I>$talking,</I> which the <TT>shift</TT> stores into <TT>$self</TT>. 
        (It's customary to shift the first parameter off into a variable named 
        <I>$self</I> for instance methods.) Then, <TT>$self</TT> gets 
        dereferenced as a scalar ref, yielding <TT>Mr.Ed</TT>, and we're done 
        with that. The result is:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>Mr. Ed says neigh.

        a <I>Horse</I> are visible. That's good if you're a veterinarian, but 
        not if you just like to own horses. So, let's let the <I>Horse</I> class 
        build a new horse:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>{ package Horse;

        <P>Notice we're back to a class method, so the two arguments to 
        <I>Horse::named</I> are <TT>Horse </TT>and <TT>Mr. Ed</TT>. The 
        <TT>bless</TT> operator not only blesses <TT>$name</TT>, it also returns 
        the reference to <TT>$name</TT>, so that's fine as a return value. And 
        that's how to build a horse.</P>
        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>Inheriting the Constructor</B></P>
        <P>But was there anything specific to <I>Horse</I> in that method? No. 
        Therefore, it's also the same recipe for building anything else that 
        inherited from <I>Animal, </I>so let's put it there:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>{ package Animal;

}
{ package Horse;
   @ISA = qw(Animal);
   sub sound { "neigh" }
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Ahh, but what happens if we invoke <I>speak</I> on an instance?</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>my $talking = Horse-&gt;named("Mr. Ed");
$talking-&gt;speak;
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>

        <P><PRE>a Horse=SCALAR(0xaca42ac) goes neigh!
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Why do we get a debugging value? That's because the 
        <I>Animal::speak</I> routine is expecting a classname as its first 
        parameter, not an instance. When the instance is passed in, we'll end up 
        using a blessed scalar reference as a string, and that shows up as we

        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>Making a Method Work with Either Classes or 
        Instances</B></P>
        <P>All that we really need is for a method to be able to recognize if it 
        is being called on a class or called on an instance. The most 
        straightforward way is with the <I>ref</I> operator. This returns a 
        string (the classname) when used on a blessed reference, and 
        <TT>undef</TT> when used on a string (like a classname). Let's modify 
        the <I>name</I> method first to notice the change:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>sub name {
   my $either = shift;
   ref $either
      ? $$either # it's an instance, return name
      : "an unnamed $either"; # it's a  class, return generic    
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Here, the <TT>?:</TT> operator comes in handy to select either the 
        dereference or a derived string. Now we can use this with either an 
        instance or a class. Note that I've changed the first parameter holder 
        to <TT>$either</TT> to show that this is intended:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>my $talking = Horse-&gt;named("Mr. Ed");
print Horse-&gt;name, "\n"; # prints  "an unnamed Horse\n"
print $talking-&gt;name, "\n"; # prints "Mr Ed.\n"
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>and now we'll fix <I>speak</I> to use this:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>sub speak {
   my $either = shift;
   print $either-&gt;name, " goes ", $either-&gt;
      sound, "\n";
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>And since <I>sound </I>already worked with either a class or an 
        instance, we're done!</P>
        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>Adding Parameters to a Method</B></P>

        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>More Interesting Instances</B></P>
        <P>What if an instance needs more data? Most interesting instances are 
        made of many items, each of which can in turn be a reference or even 
        another object. The easiest way to store these is often in a hash. </P>
        <P>The keys of the hash serve as the names of parts of the object (often 
        called "instance variables" or "member variables"), and the 
        corresponding values are commonly known as, well, the values.</P>
        <P>But how do we turn the horse into a hash? Recall that an object was 
        any blessed reference. We can just as easily make it a blessed hash 
        reference as a blessed scalar reference, as long as everything that 
        looks at the reference is changed accordingly.</P>
        <P>Let's make a sheep that has a name and a color:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>my $bad = bless { Name =&gt; "Evil", Color =&gt;
   "black" }, Sheep;
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>so <I>$bad-&gt;{Name}</I> has <TT>Evil</TT>, and 
        <I>$bad-&gt;{Color}</I> has <TT>black</TT>. But we want to make 
        <I>$bad-&gt;name</I> access the name, and that's now messed up because 
        it's expecting a scalar reference. Not to worry, because that's pretty 
        easy to fix up:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>## in Animal
sub name {
   my $either = shift;
   ref $either ?
      $either-&gt;{Name} :
      "an unnamed $either";
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>And of course <I>named </I>still builds a scalar sheep, so let's fix 
        that as well:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>## in Animal
sub named {
   my $class = shift;
   my $name = shift;
   my $self = { Name =&gt; $name, Color =&gt;
      $class-&gt;default_color };
   bless $self, $class;
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>What's this <TT>default_color</TT>? Well, if <I>named </I>has only 
        the name, we still need to set a color, so we'll have a class-specific 
        initial color. For a sheep, we might choose to define it as white:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>## in Sheep
sub default_color { "white" }
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>And then to keep from having to define one for each additional class, 
        we'll define a "backstop" method that serves as the "default default," 
        directly in <I>Animal</I>:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>## in Animal
sub default_color { "brown" }
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Now, because <I>name </I>and <I>named</I>were the only methods that 
        referenced the "structure" of the object, the rest of the methods can 
        remain the same, so <I>speak </I>still works as before.</P>
        <P class=SUBHEAD><B>A Horse of a Different Color</B></P>
        <P>But having all our horses be brown would be boring. So let's add a 
        method or two to get and set the color.</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>## in Animal
sub color {
   $_[0]-&gt;{Color}
}
sub set_color {
   $_[0]-&gt;{Color} = $_[1];
}
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>Note the alternate way of accessing the arguments: <TT>$_[0]</TT> is 
        used in-place, rather than with a <I>shift. </I>(This saves us a bit of 
        time for something that may be invoked frequently.) And now we can fix 
        that color for Mr. Ed:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>my $talking = Horse-&gt;named("Mr. Ed");
$talking-&gt;set_color("black-and-white");
print $talking-&gt;name, " is colored ",
   $talking-&gt;color, "\n";
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>which results in:</P>
        <DIV class=LISTING>
        <P><PRE>Mr. Ed is colored black-and-white
</PRE>
        <P></P></DIV>
        <P>So, now we have class methods, constructors, instance methods, 
        instance data, and even accessors. But that's still just the beginning 
        of what Perl has to offer. We haven't even begun to talk about accessors 
        that double as getters and setters, destructors, indirect object 
        notation, subclasses that add instance data, per-class data, 
        overloading, <I>isa</I> and <I>can </I>tests, <I>UNIVERSAL</I> class, 
        and so on. Perhaps in a future column, eh?</P>
