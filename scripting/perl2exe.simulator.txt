# Simulate a Perl installer like Perl2Exe:
# Add this to bottom of script to determine your dependencies:
END { print join( $/, values %INC ), $/ }

# Run script e.g. perla "runsascon.pl helloworld.sas 6" and remember any
# required paths that are printed.

# cp -R c:\Perl to a temp dir.
# Delete most modules not mentioned by the above output. Try your script on
# the copy. Recopy any parts that you shouldn't have deleted.  
#
# Put your script into the "bin" subdirectory. Put this into "run.bat" in the
# main directory. Zip it up.
bin\perl bin\runsascon.pl "%1" "%2"

# Execute like this (assumes helloworld.sas in in the same dir and this script
# takes 2 parameters):
cd c:\foo\
run helloworld.sas 6
