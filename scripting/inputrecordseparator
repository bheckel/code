Input record separator is $/
It can be anything, including multiple characters.
Normally it's \n newline.

# Want no IRS so whole file is one long record, newlines included.
undefine $/;

# idiom:
{
  # Saves previous value of $/, and substitutes it with undef, no need to
  # restore it later.
  local $/ = undef; 
  $a = <FH>;        # slurp all of FH into $a
}
