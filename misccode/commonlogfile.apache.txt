Common Log Format

A typical configuration for the access log might look as follows.

    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
    CustomLog logs/access_log common 

This defines the nickname common and associates it with a particular log
format string. The format string consists of percent directives, each of which
tell the server to log a particular piece of information. Literal characters
may also be placed in the format string and will be copied directly into the
log output. The quote character (") must be escaped by placing a back-slash
before it to prevent it from being interpreted as the end of the format
string. The format string may also contain the special control characters "\n"
for new-line and "\t" for tab.

The CustomLog directive sets up a new log file using the defined nickname. The
filename for the access log is relative to the ServerRoot unless it begins
with a slash.

The above configuration will write log entries in a format known as the Common
Log Format (CLF). This standard format can be produced by many different web
servers and read by many log analysis programs. The log file entries produced
in CLF will look something like this:

    127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 

Each part of this log entry is described below.

127.0.0.1 (%h)
    This is the IP address of the client (remote host) which made the request to the server. If HostnameLookups is set to On, then the server will try to determine the hostname and log it in place of the IP address. However, this configuration is not recommended since it can significantly slow the server. Instead, it is best to use a log post-processor such as logresolve to determine the hostnames. The IP address reported here is not necessarily the address of the machine at which the user is sitting. If a proxy server exists between the user and the server, this address will be the address of the proxy, rather than the originating machine.
- (%l)
    The "hyphen" in the output indicates that the requested piece of information is not available. In this case, the information that is not available is the RFC 1413 identity of the client determined by identd on the clients machine. This information is highly unreliable and should almost never be used except on tightly controlled internal networks. Apache httpd will not even attempt to determine this information unless IdentityCheck is set to On.
frank (%u)
    This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP authentication. The same value is typically provided to CGI scripts in the REMOTE_USER environment variable. If the status code for the request (see below) is 401, then this value should not be trusted because the user is not yet authenticated. If the document is not password protected, this entry will be "-" just like the previous one.
[10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] (%t)
    The time that the server finished processing the request. The format is:

        [day/month/year:hour:minute:second zone]
        day = 2*digit
        month = 3*letter
        year = 4*digit
        hour = 2*digit
        minute = 2*digit
        second = 2*digit
        zone = (`+' | `-') 4*digit 

    It is possible to have the time displayed in another format by specifying %{format}t in the log format string, where format is as in strftime(3) from the C standard library. 
"GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" (\"%r\")
    The request line from the client is given in double quotes. The request line contains a great deal of useful information. First, the method used by the client is GET. Second, the client requested the resource /apache_pb.gif, and third, the client used the protocol HTTP/1.0. It is also possible to log one or more parts of the request line independently. For example, the format string "%m %U%q %H" will log the method, path, query-string, and protocol, resulting in exactly the same output as "%r".
200 (%>s)
    This is the status code that the server sends back to the client. This information is very valuable, because it reveals whether the request resulted in a successful response (codes beginning in 2), a redirection (codes beginning in 3), an error caused by the client (codes beginning in 4), or an error in the server (codes beginning in 5). The full list of possible status codes can be found in the HTTP specification (RFC2616 section 10).
2326 (%b)
    The last entry indicates the size of the object returned to the client, not including the response headers. If no content was returned to the client, this value will be "-". To log "0" for no content, use %B instead.
