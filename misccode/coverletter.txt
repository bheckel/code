Dear [ ]:

I was excited to find the job posting for a SAS Programmer on your website.  
After searching for a SAS position for a while now, they all seemed to branch 
out into an unusual requirement.  As a SAS Programmer for more than a decade 
(Institute-certified for the last 8), I know I will be able to bring the skills 
you need to meet your client's requirements.

My resume will provide details into my career, in all but one role I performed
Base SAS programming.  I truly enjoy creating programs that help solve business 
problems.  At the CDC I was involved in time series analysis reports that 
helped statisticians identify trends in birth and death records.  At 
Comprehensive Neuroscience I enhanced programs used to determine unusual 
prescriptions from prescribing doctors.  And at my current role with GSK I 
designed a data warehouse app that pulls in data from multiple sources to 
present trending of lab results.

I've worked on mainframe, PC and Unix (my favorite) platforms.

I think my background would be very useful in helping you to [ job description 
words ].  I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials, I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,

Bob
