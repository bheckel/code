
Static vs. Shared Libraries

On Linux, static libraries have names like libname.a, while shared libraries
are called libname.so.x.y.z where x.y.z is some form of version number. Shared
libraries often also have links pointing to them, which are important.  The
standard libraries come in both shared and static formats.
You can find out what shared libraries a program requires by using ldd (List
Dynamic Dependencies) 
$ ldd /usr/bin/lynx
