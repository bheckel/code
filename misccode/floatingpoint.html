Software</A></UL><P>This document explains the IEEE 754 floating-point
standard.  It explains the binary representation of these numbers, how to
convert to decimal from floating point, how to convert from floating point to
decimal, discusses special cases in floating point, and finally ends with some
C code to further one's understanding of floating point.  This document does
not cover operations with floating point numbers.</P><P>I wrote this
document so that if you know how to represent, you can skip the representation
section, and if you know how to convert to decimal from single precision, you
can skip that section, and if you know how to convert to single precision from
decimal, you can skip that section.</P><A
NAME="representation"></A><H2>Representation</H2><P>First, know that
binary numbers can have, if you'll forgive my saying so, a decimal point.  It
works more or less the same way that the decimal point does with decimal
numbers.  For example, the decimal 22.589 is merely 22 and 5*10<SUP>-1</SUP> +
8*10<SUP>-2</SUP> + 9*10<SUP>-3</SUP>.  Similarly, the binary number 101.001 is
simply 1*2<SUP>2</SUP> + 0*2<SUP>1</SUP> + 1*2<SUP>0</SUP> + 0*2<SUP>-1</SUP> +
0*2<SUP>-2</SUP> + 1*2<SUP>-3</SUP>, or rather simply 2<SUP>2</SUP> +
2<SUP>0</SUP> + 2<SUP>-3</SUP> (this particular number works out to be 5.125,
if that helps your thinking).</P><P>Second, know that binary numbers, like
decimal numbers, can be represented in scientific notation.  E.g., The decimal
923.52 can be represented as 9.2352 * 10<SUP>2</SUP>.  Similarly, binary
numbers can be expressed that way as well.  Say we have the binary number
101011.101 (which is 43.625).  This would be represented using scientific
notation as 1.01011101 * 2<SUP>5</SUP>.</P><P>Now that I'm sure the
understanding is perfect, I can finally get into representation.  The single
precision floating point unit is a packet of 32 bits, divided into three
sections one bit, eight bits, and twenty-three bits, in that order.  I will
make use of the previously mentioned binary number 1.01011101 * 2<SUP>5</SUP>
to illustrate how one would take a binary number in scientific notation and
represent it in floating point notation.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=4

Field</H3><P>The first section is one bit long, and is the sign bit.  It is
either 0 or 1; 0 indicates that the number is positive, 1 negative.  The number
1.01011101 * 2<SUP>5</SUP> is positive, so this field would have a value of
0.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT

Field</H3><P>The second section is eight bits long, and serves as the
"exponent" of the number as it is expressed in scientific notation as explained
above (there is a caveat, so stick around).  A field eight bits long can have
values ranging from 0 to 255.  How would the case of a negative exponent be
covered?  To cover the case of negative values, this "exponent" is actually 127
greater than the "real" exponent a of the 2<SUP>a</SUP> term in the scientific
notation.  Therefore, in our 1.01011101 x 2<SUP>5</SUP> number, the eight-bit
exponent field would have a decimal value of 5 + 127 = 132.  In binary this is
10000100.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR><TD

Field</H3><P>The third section is twenty-three bits long, and serves as the
"mantissa."  (The mantissa is sometimes called the significand.)  The mantissa
is merely the "other stuff" to the left of the 2<SUP>a</SUP> term in our binary
number represented in scientific notation.  In our 1.01011101 * 2<SUP>5</SUP>
number, you would think that the mantissa, in all its 23 bit glory, would take
the value 10101110100000000000000, but it does not.  If you think about it, all
numbers expressed in binary notation would have a leading 1.  Why?  In decimal
scientific notation there should never be expressed a value with a leading 0,
like 0.2392 * 10<SUP>3</SUP> or something.  This would be expressed instead as
2.392 * 10<SUP>2</SUP>.  The point is, there is never a leading 0 in scientific
notation, and it makes no difference whether we're talking about binary or
decimal or hexadecimal or whatever.  The advantage of binary, though, is that
if a digit can't be 0, it must be 1!  So, the 1 is assumed to be there and is
left out to give us just that much more precision.  Thus, our mantissa for our
number would in fact be 01011101000000000000000.  (The long stream of 0s at the
end has one more zero than the alternative number at the beginning of this
paragragh.)</P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR><TD

Precision vs. Single Precision</H3><P>In addition to the single precision
floating point described here, there are also double precision floating point
units.  These have 64 bits instead of 32, and instead of field lengths of 1, 8,
and 23 as in single precision, have field lengths of 1, 11, and 44.  The
exponent field contains a value that is actually 1023 larger than the "true"
exponent, rather than being larger by 127 as in single precision.  Otherwise,
it is exactly the same.</P><A NAME="hex2dec"></A><H2>Conversion from
Floating Point Representation to Decimal</H2><P>Now I'll talk about
conversation.</P><P>Conversion to decimal is very simple if you know how
these numbers are represented.  Let's take the hexadecimal number 0xC0B40000,
and suppose it is actually a single precision floating point unit that we want
to make into a decimal number.  First convert each digit to
binary.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR

almost fun, yeah?</P><A NAME="dec2hex"></A><H2>Conversion from Decimal to
Floating Point Representation</H2><P>Say we have the decimal number
329.390625 and we want to represent it using floating point numbers.  The
method is to first convert it to binary scientific notation, and then use what
we know about the representation of floating point numbers to show the 32 bits
that will represent it.</P><P>If you know how to put a decimal into binary
scientific notation, you'll get no benefit from reading this.  If you don't,
read this.</P><P>The first step is to convert what there is to the left of
the decimal point to binary.  329 is equivalent to the binary 101001001.  Then,
leave yourself with what is to the right of the decimal point, in our example
0.390625.</P><P>Yes, I deliberately chose that number to be so convoluted
that it wasn't perfectly obvious what the binary representation would be.
There is an algorithm to convert to different bases that is simple,
straightforward, and largely foolproof.  I'll illustrate it for base two.  Our
base is 2, so we multiply this number times 2.  We then record whatever is to
the left of the decimal place after this operation.  We then take this number
and discard whatever is to the left of the decimal place, and continue with
this progress on the resulting number.  This is how it would be done with
0.390625.</P><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>0.390625</TD><TD>* 2</TD><TD

zero, we're done with that.  The binary representation of the number beyond the
decimal point can be read from the right column, from the top number downward.
This is 0.011001.</P><P>As an aside, it is important to note that not all
numbers are resolved so conveniently or quickly as sums of lower and lower
powers of two (a number as simple as 0.2 is an example).  If they are not so
easily resolved, we merely continue on this process until we have however many
bits we need to fill up the mantissa.</P><P>As another aside, to the more
ambitious among you that don't know already, since this algorithm works
similarly for all bases you could just as well use this for any other
conversion you have to attempt.  This can be used to your advantage in this
process by converting using base 16.</P><TABLE

from hex to binary, 0x64 is 0110 0100, which is the same result as the 011001
yielded above.  This method is much faster.</P><P>Anyway!  We take those
numbers that we got, and represent them as .011001, placing them in the order
we acquired them.  Put in sequence with our binary representation of 329, we
get 101001001.011001.  In our binary scientific notation, this is
1.01001001011001 * 2<SUP>8</SUP>.  We then use what we know about how single
precision numbers are represented to complete this process.</P><P>The sign
is positive, so the sign field is 0.</P><P>The exponent is 8.  8 + 127 =
135, so the exponent field is 10000111.</P><P>The mantissa is merely
01001001011001 (remember the implied 1 of the mantissa means we don't include
the leading 1) plus however many 0s we have to add to the right side to make
that binary number 23 bits long.</P><P>Since one of the homework problems
involves representing this as hex, I will finish with a hex
number.</P><P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR><TD

number is 0x43A4B200.</P><A NAME="special"></A><H2>Special
Numbers</H2><P>Sometimes the computer feels a need to put forth a result of
a calculation that reflects that some error was made.  Perhaps the magnitude of
the result of a calculation was larger or smaller than this format would seem
to be able to support.  Perhaps you attempted to divide by zero.  Perhaps
you're trying to represent zero!  How does one deal with these issues?  The
answer is that there are special cases of floating point numbers, specifically
when the exponent field is all 1 bits (255) or all 0 bits
(0).</P><H3>Denormalized Numbers</H3><P>If you have an exponent field
that's all zero bits, this is what's called a denormalized number.  With the
exponent field equal to zero, you would think that the real exponent would be
-127, so this number would take the form of 1.MANTISSA * 2<SUP>-127</SUP> as
described above, but it does not.  Instead, it is 0.MANTISSA *
2<SUP>-126</SUP>.  Notice that the exponent is no longer the value of the
exponent field minus 127.  It is simply -126.  Also notice that we no longer
include an implied one bit for the mantissa.</P><P>As an example, take the
floating point number represented as 0x80280000.  First, convert this to
binary.</P><P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TR

sign bit is 1, so this number is negative.  Our exponent is 0, so we know this
is a denormalized number.  Our mantissa is 0101, which reflects a real mantissa
of 0.0101; remember we don't include what was previously an implied one bit for
an exponent of zero.  So, this means we have a number
-0.0101<SUB>2</SUB>*2<SUP>-126</SUP> = -0.3125<SUB>10</SUB>*2<SUP>-126</SUP> =
-1.25<SUB>10</SUB>*2<SUP>-128</SUP>.</P><H3>Zero</H3><P>You can think
of zero as simply another denormalized number.  Zero is represented by an
exponent of zero and a mantissa of zero.  From our understanding of
denormalized numbers, this translates into 0*2<SUP>-126</SUP> = 0.  This sign
bit can be either positive (0) or negative (1), leading to either a positive or
negative zero.  This doesn't make very much sense mathematically, but it is
allowed.</P><H3>Infinity</H3><P>Just as the case of all zero bits in
the exponent field is a special case, so is the case of all one bits.  If the
exponent field is all ones, and the mantissa is all zeros, then this number is
an infinity.  There can be either positive or negative infinities depending on
the sign bit.  For example, 0x7F800000 is positive infinity, and 0xFF800000 is
negative infinity.</P><H3>NaN (Not a Number)</H3><P>These special
quantities have an exponent field of 255 (all one bits) like infinity, but
differ from the representation of infinity in that the mantissa contains some
one bits.  It doesn't matter where they are or how many of them there are, just
so long as there are some.  The sign bit appears to have no bearing on this.
Examples of this special quantity include 0x7FFFFFFF, 0xFF81ABD0, 0x7FAA12F9,
and soforth.</P><H3>Summary of Special Cases</H3><P>A summary of
special cases is shown in the below table.  It is more or less a copy of the
table found on page 301 of the second edition of Computer Organization and
Design, the Hardware Software Interface" by Patterson and Hennessy, the
textbook for Computer Science 104 in the Spring 2000 semester.  Even though
only single precision was covered in the above text, I include double precision
