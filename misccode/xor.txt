xor true (i.e. 1) if either is nonzero but not both. E.g. $soup xor $salad is
true if you choose soup only or salad only as your meal.

Important side effect  is if you XOR two values and then XOR the result with
either of the original values, you get back to the other original value
e.g. 74 xor 110 = 36
36 xor 110 = 74
Repeat that for all bytes in the text and you've encrypted and decrypted your
text.


xor(int a, int b) {
   return (a || b) && !(a && b)
}

a or b but not both
