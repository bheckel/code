
UNION ALL
The UNION ALL operator concatenates all of the rows returned by each SELECT
into one large table. If the two SELECT blocks generate N and M rows,
respectively, the resulting table will have N+M rows.

UNION
The UNION operator is very similar to the UNION ALL operator, but it will
eliminate any duplicate rows, including duplicates that came from the same
SELECT block. If the two SELECT blocks generate N and M rows, respectively, the
resulting table can have anywhere from 1 to N+M rows.

INTERSECT
The INTERSECT operator will return one instance of any row that is found (one
or more times) in both SELECT blocks. If the two SELECT blocks generate N and M
rows, respectively, the resulting table can have anywhere from 0 to MIN(N,M)
rows.

EXCEPT
The EXCEPT operator will return all of the rows in the first SELECT block that
are not found in the second SELECT block. It is essentially a subtraction
operator. If there are duplicate rows in the first block, they will all be
eliminated by a single, matching row in the second block. If the two SELECT
blocks generate N and M rows, respectively, the resulting table can have
anywhere from 0 to N rows.
