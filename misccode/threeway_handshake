
1. Computer A (active open) sends a segment with

SYN=1

ACK=0

Sequence Number = X (where X is Computer A's ISN)

The active open computer (Computer A) sends a segment with the
SYN flag set to one and the ACK flag set to zero. SYN stands for
synchronize. This flag, as described earlier, announces an attempt to
open a connection. This first segment header also contains the initial
sequence number, which marks the beginning of the sequence numbers
for data that Computer A will transmit. The first byte transmitted to
Computer B will have the sequence number ISN+1.



2.  Computer B (passive open) receives Computer A's segment and returns a
    segment with

SYN = 1 (still in synchronization phase)

ACK = 1 (the Acknowledgment Number field will contain a value)

Sequence number = Y, where Y is Computer B's ISN

Acknowledgment number = M + 1, where M is the last sequence number
received from A



3.  Computer A sends a segment to Computer B that acknowledges receipt of
    Computer B's ISN

SYN=0

ACK=1

Sequence number = next sequence number in series (M+1)

Acknowledgment number = N+1 (where N is the last sequence number received
from B)
