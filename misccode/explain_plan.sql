-- 
-- Attributes of Explain Plan Operations:
-- 
-- There are two different ways databases use indexes to apply the WHERE clauses (predicates):
-- - ACCESS PREDICATES express the start and stop conditions for the leaf node traversal. They
--   define the scanned index range, which is hopefully narrow.
-- 
-- - FILTER PREDICATES are applied during the leaf node traversal only. They don't
--   contribute to the start and stop conditions and do not narrow the scanned index range. It is
--   possible to modify an index and turn a filter predicate into an access predicate (e.g. by
--   changing indexed column order, etc.).
-- 
-- A- No index
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- |Id | Operation                   | Name       | Rows | Cost |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- | 0 | SELECT STATEMENT            |            |   17 |  230 |
-- |*1 |  TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID| EMPLOYEES  |   17 |  230 |
-- |*2 |   INDEX RANGE SCAN          | EMPLOYEE_PK|  333 |    2 |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- 
-- Predicate Information (identified by operation id):
-- ---------------------------------------------------
--    1 - filter(UPPER("LAST_NAME") LIKE '%INA%')
--    2 - access("SUBSIDIARY_ID"=TO_NUMBER(:A))
-- 
-- B- CREATE INDEX empsubupnam ON employees (subsidiary_id, UPPER(last_name))
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- |Id | Operation                   | Name       | Rows | Cost |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- | 0 | SELECT STATEMENT            |            |   17 |   20 |
-- | 1 |  TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID| EMPLOYEES  |   17 |   20 |
-- |*2 |   INDEX RANGE SCAN          | EMPSUBUPNAM|   17 |    3 | <--- +1 because index is bigger due to adding last_name
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
-- 
-- Predicate Information (identified by Operation Id):
-- ---------------------------------------------------
--    2 - access("SUBSIDIARY_ID"=TO_NUMBER(:A))
--        filter(UPPER("LAST_NAME") LIKE '%INA%')
-- 
-- According to the optimizer's estimate, the query ultimately matches 17 records.
-- The index scan in the first execution plan delivers 333 rows nevertheless. The
-- database must then load these 333 rows from the table to apply the LIKE filter
-- which reduces the result to 17 rows. In the second execution plan, the index
-- access does not deliver those rows in the first place so the database needs to
-- execute the TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID operation only 17 times.
-- 
--
-- INDEX [idx name] UNIQUE SCAN 
-- Performs the B-tree traversal ONLY. The database uses this operation if a
-- unique constraint ensures that the search criteria will match no more than one
-- entry.  The database does not need to follow the index leaf nodes - it is enough to 
-- traverse the index tree thanks to the primary key or other constraint.  This operation
-- cannot deliver > 1 entry so it cannot trigger > 1 table access.  Always fast.
-- 
-- INDEX [idx name] RANGE SCAN 
-- Performs the B-tree traversal AND THEN follows the leaf node chain to find all
-- matching entries.  The biggest performance risk of an INDEX RANGE SCAN is the
-- leaf node traversal.  It is therefore the golden rule of indexing to keep the
-- scanned index range as small as possible (i.e. watch your ACCESS PREDICATES).  The so-called index 
-- FILTER PREDICATES often cause performance problems for an INDEX RANGE SCAN so keep the scanned 
-- index range as small as possible.  That usually means index for equality first, then for ranges.
-- Ideally the index "covers" the entire WHERE clause so that all filters are used as access predicates.
-- 
-- TABLE ACCESS [tbl name] BY INDEX ROWID
-- Retrieves a row from the table using the ROWID retrieved from the preceding
-- index lookup access, e.g. INDEX UNIQUE SCAN.
-- 
-- INDEX [idx name] FULL SCAN
-- Reads the entire index (all rows) in index order. Depending on various system
-- statistics, the database might perform this operation if it needs all rows in
-- index orderâ€”e.g., because of a corresponding order by clause.  Instead, the
-- optimizer might also use an INDEX FAST FULL SCAN and perform an additional sort
-- operation.
-- 
-- INDEX [idx name] FAST FULL SCAN
-- Reads the entire index (all rows) as stored on the disk. This operation is
-- typically performed instead of a full table scan if all required columns are
-- available in the index. Similar to TABLE ACCESS FULL, the INDEX FAST FULL SCAN
-- can benefit from multi-block read operations.
-- 
-- TABLE ACCESS [tbl name] STORAGE FULL
-- Also known as "full table scan". Reads the entire table (all rows AND COLUMNS!) as stored on the
-- disk. Although multi-block read operations improve the speed of a full table scan considerably
-- (especially if the results involve most of the table since an index lookup reads one block
-- after the other - the database does not know which block to read next until the current block
-- has been processed), it is still one of the most expensive operations. Besides high IO rates, a
-- full table scan must inspect ALL table rows so it can also consume a considerable amount of CPU
-- time.
--
--
-- NESTED LOOPS JOIN
-- Joins two tables by fetching the result from one table and querying the other
-- table for each row from the first.
-- 
-- HASH JOIN
-- The hash join loads the candidate records from one side of the join into a hash
-- table that is then probed for each row from the other side of the join.
-- 
-- MERGE JOIN
-- The merge join combines two sorted lists like a zipper. Both sides of the join
-- must be presorted.
--
--
-- SORT ORDER BY
-- Sorts the result according to the order by clause. This operation needs large
-- amounts of memory to materialize the intermediate result (not pipelined).
-- 
-- SORT ORDER BY STOPKEY
-- Sorts a subset of the result according to the order by clause. Used for top-N
-- queries if pipelined execution is not possible.
-- 
-- SORT GROUP BY
-- Sorts the result set on the group by columns and aggregates the sorted result
-- in a second step. This operation needs large amounts of memory to materialize
-- the intermediate result set (not pipelined).
-- 
-- SORT GROUP BY NOSORT
-- Aggregates a presorted set according the group by clause. This operation does
-- not buffer the intermediate result: it is executed in a pipelined manner.
-- 
-- HASH GROUP BY
-- Groups the result using a hash table. This operation needs large amounts of
-- memory to materialize the intermediate result set (not pipelined). The output
-- is not ordered in any meaningful way.
