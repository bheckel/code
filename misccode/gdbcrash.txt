Want to know exactly why your program crashed? At the bash prompt type: 
ulimit -c 100000 

Then run your program and watch it dump core. Now run gdb like this: 
gdb program core 
Or if using Cygwin you'll need dumper.exe (may not work) to get core
gdb -nw program.exe program.exe.core 

Then do a backtrace on the core like this: 
bt
