Syntactic restriction on the form of the SELECT and HAVING clauses in queries
involving aggregate functions and/or the GROUP BY clause:

Only those columns explicitly listed in the GROUP BY clause may appear
un-aggregated (i.e. not as a parameter of an aggr. function) in the SELECT or
HAVING clauses.

Put negatively, It is prohibited to use an un-aggregated column in the SELECT
or HAVING clauses, unless it is explicitly listed in the GROUP BY clause.
