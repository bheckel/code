NULL ROOT PASSWD WITHOUT VI

As admins We never forget the root password,
RIGHT? 

Although sometimes we do inherit machines in 
which we don't know the root password. 
 
Here is a way to null the root password from 
the password file.

It comes a time in every admins life that we
will have to go into mini-root and change the
password file without the use of vi. 

The following example shows how to achieve this
on the /etc/shadow file, but the same basic 
commands can be achieved on the /etc/passwd file
for those platforms that don't support shadow 
passwords.

Use "ed" - and the 13 dots method
---------------------------------
# cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.bak
# ed /etc/shadow
1p
s/:.............:/::/ 
1p
w
q
