                          Covering Your Bases

  An explanation of how to convert from base 10 to base 2, 8, or 16


This little article was prompted by the Sierra game RAMA, a 
wonderful game that relies rather heavily on traditional number 
theory. (No, wait! I know your eyes are glazing over already when you 
saw "number theory, but really, what I'm going to explain is very 
straightforward).


                      Let's talk about bases.

When humans were first designing counting, they needed a system for 
keeping track of them. While they _eventually_ came up with writing 
numbers (and some numbers took longer than others), originally they 
counted fingers (the Abdominizer hadn't been invented yet, or we'd
all be counint base 20).   10 fingers for humans, so we use baas 10
The theory in RAMA is that aliens would use a similar reasoning
towards coming up with their own base system. 


In RAMA, humans use base 10, while another races uses base 8 (the
8 colored squares (ignore the smaller 4 color sqaures on the left side -
it's the large area of the square that's relevant), and yet another
uses base 16 (the 16 symbols). The center panel on the right side (as
you enter) to each "teaching" area shows you what symbol corresponds
to how many items.




                     Base 10 (Decimal)

Now, when I say base 10, that means there are 10 _unique_ digits in 
the numbers system. Those numbers are:

              0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9                                                     

Yep, that's 10 digits - count `em. 0 counts as a digit.
You'll notice that  10  is not amongst those numbers - because there is 
no such _single_ digit as 10 - it's two digits that represent something 
special - we'll get to that in a moment.

Whatever the base, the maximum value is one _less_ than the base. 

So, for base 10 (which we all use), the largest single digit is 9. In Base 
8, or Octal, the largest digit is 7 and the legal digits are:

             0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7

Since all the base 8 numbers fall within base 10's range, we just use 
the same symbols for the numbers.

We run into a small problem with base 16, because it's last number is 
(16 - 1 =) 15 and there must be _single_ digits for all numbers from 0 
to 15 in base 16. For whatever reason, the current convention just 
starts using upper-case letters when the numbers run out. So the valid 
number sequence for base 16 is:

0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   F

Yes, this looks a bit weird, but it works. But, you might say, why go 
thru all this rigmarole - just use 10 instead of A. Well, if 10 actually 
meant ten, we would - but it doesn't.






                    The Weight of A Number


As we learn in school, the position of each digit in a number has a 
particular meaning. Let's say I have 12 apples, denoted here by X 
symbols

    X       X      X
    X       X      X     
    X       X      X
    X       X      X          


Now, when I say "12", what exactly does that mean. 12 = 10 + 2., 
which can also be written as   12 = ( 1 x 10 )  +  ( 2 x  1 ). Putting that 
into English, we have "there is 1 group of 10s and 2 groups of 1
 
   X       X       X       X
   X       X                      
   X       X      
   X       X                
   X       X

Remember grade school and the "tens column" and "hundreds 
column"? Those are the weights of those columns. Applying that to 
12, we get  

          12 = 10 + 2     = (1 x 10) + (2 x 1)

because the 1 is in the 10s column and the 2 is in the 1s column.
The first four columns in the base 10 (decimal) system have these
weights:

                   |  1000  |   100   |   10   |    1   |


or, expressing
that in terms
of powers of
10		

                   | 10x10x10  |   10x10    |    10     |    1   |

                     10 to 3rd      10 to 2nd      10 to 1    10 to zero


(note that any number to 0th power is 1).




So, 12 means

                  | 10 to 1 power (=10) |   10 to zero power (= 1)

                          1                           2




The number 9 could be considered really as  09 or

                  | 10 to 1 power (=10) |   10 to zero power (= 1)


                          0                           9


i.e. I have no 10s and 9 1s.





If I had the number 34, how many 10s are there?  3
After that, how many 1s are left? 4


                | 10 to 1 power (=10) |   10 to zero power (= 1)

                        3                           4









                          Pieces of  8


Octal, or base 8, works the same way - except when the number is 
greater than 7 we "carry the one" instead of when the number is 
greater than 9. Let's use the 12 apples again.


    X       X      X
    X       X      X     
    X       X      X
    X       X      X          


Now, how many (groups of) 8s are in 12? 1
How many (groups of) 1s are left? 4


    X X      X     X     X     X
    X X           
    X X      
    X X                

So, 12 in base 10 is the same as 14 base 8. 


The "weights" of base 8 are similar to base 10, except they are based 
on the number 8 instead of 10


            |   8x8x8   |     8x8      |      8       |       1       |

              8 to 3rd       8 to 2nd       8 to 1       8 to zero

                512           64               8                1


A second example: Converting 312 base 10 to base 8

How many 512s are there in 312?             0
How many 64s are there in 312?              4      312 - (4x64) = 56
How many 8s are there in the remaining 56?  7      56 - 56 = 0
How many 1s are there in the remaining 0?   0

So, the answer is 0470, or since we drop leading 0s, just  0470


What if we want to convert base 8 to base 10? Reverse the process.



Example:  Given 27 base 8, what is the base 10 equivalent?

                |     8x8      |      8       |       1       |
                        
                                      2              7
                                 = (2 x 8)  +   ( 7 x 1 ) 
                                 = 23 base 10



Let's go one step farther and do addition:

Example:  Add two octal numbers - 26 and 37

There are two ways of doing this. The slow way is to convert the octal 
numbers back to decimal, add them, then convert the answer back to 
base 8. Ick!  The faster way is to add them just like you would any 
other number, except remembering to carry the 1 (and subtract 8) any 
time a column adds up to more than 7. Let's see

                          1
                          26
                       +  37
                     -----------
                          65

When we added the 7 and 6, we got a number greater than 7 so we 
subtract 8, leave the remainder and carry the 1 to the next column. If 
that second column had been more than 7 we would have carried again 
creating a third column.

Subtraction works exactly the same as decimal subtraction too, except 
that you "borrow" 8 instead of 10. Fortunately, the RAMA game won't 
ask you for negative number answers so we won't dwell on those now.







                    Your FACE is a very big number

Now we come to the tricky one, base 16. But really, other than the 
additional "digits" it acts the same way. We call the extra numbers A, 
B, C, D, E, and F - the system in RAMA has symbols for all 16 
numbers. 

Again, the columns are weighted, but we use 16 instead of 8s or 10s





   |   16x16x16   |     16x16       |      16       |        1      |

      16 to 3rd         16 to 2nd         16 to 1       16 to zero

       4096            256                  16               1


Going back to our 12 apples, we ask ourselves..



    X       X      X
    X       X      X     
    X       X      X
    X       X      X          


Now, how many 16s are in 12? 0
How many 1s are left? 12


X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X

 
Recall, from the first part, that 12, being 2 digits, can't be used and 
that in hexadecimal (hexi = 6 and decimal = 10, so 6+10 or base 16) 
uses the letter  C  as 12. 
So 12 in base 10 is the same as  C in base 16. Weird, huh?
But it follows in the normal pattern of how we deal with numbers, as 
with base 10 and base 8.


Let's try another example. 

What is 110 in base 16?


How many 16s are in 110?  6     110 - (6 x 16) = 110 - 96 = 14
How many 1s are in the remaining 14 = E

So, 110 base 10 is equal to 4E base 16



Going the other way, we translate base 16 to base 10 just like we did 
with base 8 to base 10, except using 16s

Example:  What is the base 10 equivalent of 19A



       |      16x16       |      16          |       1      |

               1                  9                  A

        = ( 1 x (16x16))  + ( 9 x 16 )  +  (A x 1)

        = ( 1 x 256 ) +  (144) + (10)                   ( A is 10)

        = 410 base 10


Finally, base 16 follows all the rules of subtraction and addition we've 
mentioned regarding "carrying"/"borrowing".  For example, let's 
subtract 2C from 40 - both hexadecimal numbers.

                                   40
                               -   2C
                              -----------

The C, or `12' must be subtracted from the 0 which is too small. So, 
we "borrow" a 16 from the `4', leaving 3

                                 3(16)
                              -  2  C
                              ---------
                                 1  4

in the right column, we subtracted 12 from 16, which left 4.



Example:   Add the two hexadecimal numbers 47  and C4

                          
                                47
                            +   C4 
                           ----------
                               10B


7 + 4 is 11, which is  B in  base 16.   C, or 12, + 4 is 16, so we drop 
down a 0 and carry the 1 to the next left column (as we would if the 
two numbers had added up to 10 in base 10 numbers).


Well, I hope this helps some of you out. If you were looking for all the 
answers - sorry. The game doesn't always ask the same values in the 
displays at Bankok, but if you understand _how_ to get the answers 
then it shouldn't be a problem. For those of you with scientific 
calculators, or Win '95 (and maybe Windows and Mac), you can also 
check to see if you have a calculator that can handle octal and 
hexadecimal conversions
