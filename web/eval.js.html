<!--
If the user types "parrot" into the prompt box, the second line creates a
string that looks like window.document.parrot. Then the eval on the third line
says, "Give me the object window.document.parrot" - which is the image object
you want. And once you have that image object, you can change its source to
ant.gif. Funky, no? It's actually pretty useful, and people do it a lot.
