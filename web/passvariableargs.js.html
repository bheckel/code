<!--
A little known functionality of JavaScript is its ability to accept one or
more arguments within a single function. This advantage saves coding time as
well as memory consumption. Thus, instead of writing different functions for
different arguments, you can write a single function which handles many
arguments or combinations of arguments. 

An instance of where you may want to use this is in programming forms. If a
form changes over time, and if you have used this functionality to validate
your form, you wouldn't have to rewrite the code, but simply modify the
existing code. Here's an example: 
-->
<SCRIPT Language="JavaScript">
  function foo() {
    // Array of argument values.
    var argv = foo.arguments;
    // The number of arguments passed to this function.
    var argc = argv.length;
    // For formatting purposes only.
    document.write("<BR><BR>\n\n");
    // Loop through the arguments (0 through n-1).
    for (var i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
      // Write out the argument values.
      document.write("<BR>\nValue of Argument " + i + ": " + argv[i]);
    }
  }
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
  <CENTER><H1>Arguments passed to function "foo"</H1></CENTER>
  <SCRIPT>
    // CALLING THE FUNCTION THREE TIMES:
    foo(1, "two", 3);
    foo("Testing ONE Argument.");
    foo(3.14159, "Netscape", "Communicator", "Coming", "Soon!");
  </SCRIPT>
