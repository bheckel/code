Very Basic
==========
+ What SAS statements would you code to read an external raw data file to a
DATA step?

filename F 't.txt';
infile F DSD MISSOVER LRECL=256 FIRSTOBS=2;
input foo :$40.;


+ How do you read in the variables that you need?

input


+ Are you familiar with special input delimiters? How are they used?

infile TABDEL DLM='09'x DSD MISSOVER;


+ If reading a variable length file with fixed input, how would you prevent
SAS from reading the next record if the last variable didn't have a value?

FLOWOVER uses next line to fill its vars "SAS went to a new line when..."
MISSOVER sets them to missing
STOPOVER halts datastep, does not get creative behind your back


+ What is the difference between an informat and a format? Name three
informats or formats.

Formats modify existing SAS, informats convert raw into SAS.
"the the format prints and informat converts"

BEST. MONYY. DOLLAR8.2 Z3. DATE9.


+ Name and describe three SAS functions that you have used, if any?

substr(), sum(), system()


+ How would you code the criteria to restrict the output to be produced?

IF or WHERE statements in the datastep.  The WHERE statement selects
observations before they are brought into the program data vector, making it a
more efficient programming technique. The subsetting IF statement works on
observations AFTER they are read into the program data vector.


+ What is the purpose of the trailing @? The @@? How would you use them?

Use a single trailing @ to allow the next INPUT statement to read again from
the same record. Use a double trailing @ to hold a record for the next INPUT
statement across iterations of the DATA step.


+ Under what circumstances would you code a SELECT construct instead of IF
statements?

When you have a long series of mutually exclusive conditions, using a SELECT
group is more efficient than using a series of IF-THEN statements because CPU
time is reduced. SELECT groups also make the program easier to read and debug.


+ What statement do you code to tell SAS that it is to write to an external
file? What statement do you code to write the record to the file?

filename
file
put


+ If reading an external file to produce an external file, what is the
shortcut to write that record without coding every single variable on the
record?

"a--b"


+ If you're not wanting any SAS output from a data step, how would you code
the data statement to prevent SAS from producing a set?

data _NULL_;


+ What is the one statement to set the criteria of data that can be coded in
any step?

WHERE


+ Have you ever linked SAS code? If so, describe the link and any required
statements used to either process the code or the step itself.

%include 'foo.sas';


+ How would you include common or reuse code to be processed along with your
statements?

%include


+ When looking for data contained in a character string of 150 bytes, which
function is the best to locate that data: scan, index, or indexc?

index


+ If you have a data set that contains 100 variables, but you need only five
of those, what is the code to force SAS to use only those variable?

keep=


+ Code a PROC SORT on a data set containing State, District and County as the
primary variables, along with several numeric variables.

? wtf ?


+ How would you delete duplicate observations?

NODUPKEY on proc sort statement


+ How would you delete observations with duplicate keys?

NODUPKEY on proc sort statement


+ How would you code a merge that will keep only the observations that have
matches from both sets.

...
merge t (in=in_one) tmp2 (in=in_two);
by foo;
if in_one and in_two;
...


+ How would you code a merge that will write the matches of both to one data
set, the non-matches from the left-most data set to a second data set, and the
non-matches of the right-most data set to a third data set.

data inboth nomatchin1 nomatchin2;
  merge one(in=in1) two(in=in2);
  by id;
  if in1 and in2       then output inboth;
  if (in1=0 and in2=1) then output nomatchin1;
  if (in1 and not in2) then output nomatchin2;
run;
