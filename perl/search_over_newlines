A Simpler Way to Deal with the Continuation Lines
This is a general pattern that you can apply to any problem that involves
continuations or escape sequences. It's fairly simple, but it turns out that
in Perl there's an even simpler way to write the same thing, if we're willing
to use a little regex magic: 


        @logical_lines = split /\n(?!\s)/, $header;

What's going on here? It says that the delimiters between header lines
aren't \n characters; just an \n by itself isn't enough. (?!foo) says that in
order to match, perl must not see foo coming up at that position in the
string. (?!\s) says that the next character after the \n must not be a
whitespace character. So where /\n/ will match any newline character,
/\n(?!\s)/ will only match the newline characters that are not immediately
followed by whitespace. These are precisely the ones that are at the ends of
logical lines.
