<a name="lk1"><h3>Advanced Form Processing</h3></a>
In the last lesson, you learned how to decode form data, and mail it
to yourself.  However, one problem with the previous script is, it doesn't
allow for any error-checking, or specialized processing.  You might not
want to get blank forms, or you may want to require certain fields to
be filled out.  You might also want to write a quiz or questionnaire,
and have your script take different actions depending on the answers.  All
of these things require some more advanced processing of the form data.<p>

All that's required here is to know how to test conditions in Perl.
Probably the main one you'll use in a form-handling script is the
if-elsif condition:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
if ($varname eq "somestring") {
   ...do stuff here if the condition is true
}
elsif ($varname eq "someotherstring") {
   ...do other stuff
}
else {
   ...do this if none of the other conditions are met
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <b>elsif</b> and <b>else</b> blocks are optional; if you are only
testing whether a particular variable is true or not, you can just use
a single <b>if</b> block.<p>

In Perl there are different conditional test operators, depending on
whether the variable you want to test is a string or a number.  Here's
the list of them:<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th></th><th>Numbers</th><th>Strings</th></tr>
<tr><td>$x is equal to $y</td><td>$x == $y</td><td>$x eq $y</td></tr>
<tr><td>$x is not equal to $y</td><td>$x != $y</td><td>$x ne $y</td></tr>
<tr><td>$x is greater than $y</td><td>$x > $y</td><td>$x gt $y</td></tr>
<tr><td>$x is greater than or equal to $y</td><td>$x >= $y</td><td>$x ge $y</td></tr>
<tr><td>$x is less than $y</td><td>$x < $y</td><td>$x lt $y</td></tr>
<tr><td>$x is less than or equal to $y</td><td>$x <= $y</td><td>$x le $y</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Basically, if it's a string test, you use the letter operators (eq, ne,
lt, etc.), and if its a numeric test, you use the symbols (==, !=, etc.).
Most form data is going to be string values, so you'll probably use the
letter operators most of the time.<p>

Let's try it.  Copy your form2.cgi to a new script called form3.cgi, and
insert this conditional test before the open(MAIL) statement:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
if ($FORM{'name'} eq "") {
   print "&lt;h2&gt;Error!&lt;/h2&gt;\n";
   print "Please fill out the field for your name.&lt;p&gt;";
   die;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Now try testing it.  Just push "submit" below, without filling out any
of the fields:<p>

<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form3.cgi" method="POST">
<center><pre>
       Your Name: <input type="text" name="name">
   Email Address: <input type="text" name="email">
             Age: <input type="text" name="age">
  Favorite_Color: <input type="text" name="favorite_color">
</pre>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset">
</center>
</form>
<p>
A blank form submission will give you an error, but if you fill out the
field for your name, it will succeed.<p>

You can extend this to test for multiple fields at the same time:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
if ($FORM{'name'} eq "" || $FORM{'email'} eq "" || $FORM{'age'} eq "") {
   print "&lt;h2&gt;Error!&lt;/h2&gt;\n";
   print "Please fill out the field for your name.&lt;p&gt;";
   die;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above code will return an error if any of the name, email, or age
fields are left blank.  The conditions are separated by the <b>||</b>
operator, which is an OR statement - if any of (1 or 2 or 3) is true, then
the condition is met.<p>

<a name="lk2"><h3>Handling Checkboxes</h3></a>
You may want to include checkboxes in your form, to allow the viewer
to select one or more options.  But how do you decode these inside
your CGI?<p>
If you just want to display them in your email message, you can just
print them like you would any text field; each checkbox has a different
name.  Here's an example of the HTML form code for checkboxes:<p>
<ul><pre>
  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="red" value=1&gt; Red&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="green" value=1&gt; Green&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="blue" value=1&gt; Blue&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="gold" value=1&gt; Gold&lt;br&gt;
</ul></pre>
<p>
This example lets the viewer pick as many options as they want - or none,
if they prefer.  While you can set the <b>value="whatever"</b> part of the
checkbox field to any value you want, if you use integer 1's, it will mean
less code is required inside the CGI.  Here's an example of the Perl code
that would deal with the above checkboxes:<p>
<ul><pre>
  @colors = ("red","green","blue","gold");
  foreach $x (@colors) {
     if ($FORM{$x} == 1) {
        print "You picked $x.\n";
     }
  }
</ul></pre>
<p>
NOTE:  if you use <b>value=1</b>, then your Perl code can use
<b>$FORM{$x} == 1</b>.  If you mistakenly put quotes around the 1, such as
<b>value="1"</b>, then your Perl code will not work unless you change the
<b> == </b> operator to an <b>eq</b>.  1 is an integer number, "1" is a
string.<p>

Here's the above code in action.<p>
<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form4.cgi" method="POST">
Choose the colors you like:<p>
<ul>
  <input type="checkbox" name="red" value=1> Red<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="green" value=1> Green<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="blue" value=1> Blue<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="gold" value=1> Gold<br>
</ul>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset"></form><p>

<a name="lk3"><h3>Handling Radio Buttons</h3></a>
Radio buttons differ from checkboxes in that you can have several buttons
that share the same field name in the form itself - thus allowing the
viewer to only select one of a series of options.  To distinguish each
option, the buttons themselves must have different values.  For example:<p>
<ul><pre>
  &lt;input type="radio" name="color" value="red"&gt; Red&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" name="color" value="green"&gt; Green&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"&gt; Blue&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" name="color" value="gold"&gt; Gold&lt;br&gt;
</ul></pre>
<p>
This is similar to our checkboxes example, only in this case, each radio
button has the same field name, but a different <b>value</b>.  It's easiest
to set the value to a relevant name of the thing being picked - in this case
the values are set to the name of the color being picked.  Radio buttons can
be handled in Perl fairly simply:<p>
<ul><pre>
  print "Your favorite color is: $FORM{'color'}&lt;br&gt;\n";
</ul></pre>
<p>
You see here why it is best to set the <b>value</b> to something significant
and meaningful - it lets you just print out the radio button and its value,
without having to also store another list inside your cgi, to show what
each button means.<p>

Here's the above code in action.<p>
<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form5.cgi" method="POST">
Choose your favorite color:<p>
<ul>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="green"> Green<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="gold"> Gold<br>
</ul>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset"></form><p>

You could even take the above one step further.  Say you not only want to
tell the viewer what color they picked, but you want to SHOW it to them also.
In your perl script, you could do something like this:<p>
<ul><pre>
  %colors = ("red","ff0000",
             "green","00ff00",
             "blue","0000ff",
             "gold","ffcc00");
  print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;form6.cgi&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n";
  print "&lt;body bgcolor=$colors{$FORM{'color'}}&gt;\n";
  print "&lt;h2&gt;Your favorite color is: $FORM{'color'}&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n";
  print "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";
</pre></ul><p>

The above actually sets the background color to whatever color you picked.
It's using an associative list, <b>%colors</b>, whose key values are the same
as the data value of the radio buttons in the form itself.<p>

Here's the example:<p>
<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form6.cgi" method="POST">
Choose your favorite color:<p>
<ul>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="red" checked> Red<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="green"> Green<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue<br>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="gold"> Gold<br>
</ul>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset"></form><p>
