<h2>Lesson 3</h2>

This lesson assumes that you already know how to create HTML forms.  If
not, please read the
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html">Mosaic Forms Tutorial</a> first.<p>

<h3>Processing FORM data</h3>

For any CGI that must process a form using the POST method, you'll have to
read the input from the form, and translate special characters back into
what the person actually typed in.  For example, any blank spaces in
a form field are passed along the input string as a plus sign ("+").<p>

You may have used something like cgi-lib.pl in the past to handle unparsing
your forms, but all you ever need is this bite of code right here: (special
thanks to <a href="mailto:reuven@the-tech.mit.edu">Reuven M. Lerner</a>, from
whose form-mail.pl script this was taken)<p>
<h4>form parse code</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
read(STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});
@pairs = split(/&/, $buffer);

foreach $pair (@pairs)
{
    ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $pair);

    # Un-Webify plus signs and %-encoding
    $value =~ tr/+/ /;
    $value =~ s/%([a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;

    # Stop people from using subshells to execute commands
    # Not a big deal when using sendmail, but very important
    # when using UCB mail (aka mailx).
    $value =~ s/~!/ ~!/g;

    $FORM{$name} = $value;
}
</pre></blockquote>

Now, after your cgi gets through the above block of code, you'll have
an associative array called %FORM that contains all the values that were
entered into the form.  The keys of the %FORM array are the variable
names themselves.  So, for example, if you have
three text fields in the form - called name, email-address, and age,
you could refer to them in your script by using <b>$FORM{'name'}</b>,
<b>$FORM{'email-address'}</b>, and <b>$FORM{'age'}</B>.<p>

Now, let's write a generic form-processor script, using the above code,
plus a bit more.  Create a new file called form1.cgi, and enter this code.
This is the above form-handler code, plus a loop that prints out each
variable.<p>
<blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";

read(STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});
@pairs = split(/&/, $buffer);
foreach $pair (@pairs)
{
    ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $pair);
    $value =~ tr/+/ /;
    $value =~ s/%([a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;
    $value =~ s/~!/ ~!/g;
    $FORM{$name} = $value;
}

print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Form Output&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;";
print "&lt;h2&gt;Results from FORM post&lt;/h2&gt;\n";
foreach $key (keys(%FORM)) {
   print "$key = $FORM{$key}&lt;br&gt;";
}
print "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";

</pre></blockquote>
This code can be used to handle ANY form.  Whatever variables you have
in your form, this cgi will print them out, along with the data the
person has entered.<p>

Let's test it.  Enter some stuff into the fields below, and press
"send" when finished.  The output will be the variable names of these text
boxes plus the actual data you type into each field.  (view the
<a href="l3src.txt">source</a> for this form)<p>
<hr noshade width=75%>
<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form1.cgi" method="POST">
<center><pre>
       Your Name: <input type="text" name="name">
   Email Address: <input type="text" name="email">
             Age: <input type="text" name="age">
  Favorite Color: <input type="text" name="favorite_color">

</pre>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset">
</form>
</center>
<hr noshade width=75%>
<p>

<blockquote><font color=#993300>
Tip: If you've ever built a form, and had trouble getting the boxes to
align, try putting &lt;pre&gt; tags around the input fields.  Then you
can line them up with your text editor, and the result is a much neater
looking form.  The reason for this is that most web browsers use a fixed-width
font for preformatted text, so aligning forms and other data is much easier
in a preformatted text block than in regular HTML.<p>
</blockquote></font>


There are a few special cases to note here with forms.  First, if you
have a textarea field (such as for comments), you'll need to add this
line right after the form parse code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
$FORM{'comments'} =~ s/\r/\n/;
</pre></blockquote>
All this does is replace raw linefeeds with a regular carriage return.<p>
Also, in the event of things like checkboxes and radio buttons, you'll
want to use significant variable names in your HTML form itself, so that
the data will be meaningful to you.<p>

Let's take this one step further.  Most people using forms want the data
emailed back to them, so, let's write a form-to-mail cgi.  First you'll
need to figure out where the <b>sendmail</b> program lives on the system
you're on.  (For IO, it's in <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>.  If you're not
sure where yours is, try doing <b>which sendmail</b> or <b>whereis
sendmail</b>; usually one of these two commands will yield the location
of the sendmail program.)<p>

Copy your form1.cgi to a new file named form2.cgi.  Now the only change will
be to the <b>foreach</b> loop.  Instead of printing to standard output
(the HTML page the person sees after clicking submit),
we want to print the values of the variables to a mail message.  So, first,
we must open input to the sendmail program.  You also need to specify
the recipient of the email.<p>
<font color=#993300>
Note: perl will complain if you use an "@" sign inside a regular string
(a string delimited by "double quotes") or a print &lt;&lt;EndHTML block.
You can safely put an @-sign inside a single-quote string, like
'kira@metronet.com', or you can escape the @-sign in other strings
by using a backslash.  For example, "kira\@metronet.com".<p>
</font>
<blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";

read(STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});
@pairs = split(/&/, $buffer);
foreach $pair (@pairs)
{
    ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $pair);
    $value =~ tr/+/ /;
    $value =~ s/%([a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;
    $value =~ s/~!/ ~!/g;
    $FORM{$name} = $value;
}

$mailprog = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';

# change the email address to your own (so you get the mail and not me) :)
$recipient = 'kira@metronet.com';

# this opens an output stream and pipes it directly to the sendmail
# program.
open (MAIL, "|$mailprog $recipient") || die "Can't open $mailprog!\n";

# here we're printing out the header info for the mail message.  The
# reply-to can be set to the email address of the sender, assuming you
# have actually defined a field in your form called 'email'.
print MAIL "Reply-to: $FORM{'email'} ($FORM{'name'})\n";

# print out a subject line so you know it's from your form cgi.
# The two \n\n's end the header section of the message.  anything
# you print after this point will be part of the body of the mail.
print MAIL "Subject: Form Data\n\n";

# here you're just printing out all the variables and values, just like
# before in the previous script, only the output is to the mail message
# rather than the followup HTML page.
foreach $key (keys(%FORM)) {
  print MAIL "$key = $FORM{$key}\n";
}

# when you finish writing to the mail message, be sure to close the
# input stream so it actually gets mailed.
close(MAIL);

# now print something to the HTML page, usually thanking the person
# for filling out the form, and giving them a link back to your homepage
print &lt;&lt;EndHTML;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank You&lt;/h2&gt;
Thank you for writing.  Your mail has been delivered.&lt;p&gt;
Return to the &lt;a href="http://www59.metronet.com/dev/class/"&gt;CGI Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
EndHTML

</pre></blockquote>
<p>
You don't need to include the comments in the above code; they are just
there to show you what's happening.<p>

Now let's test it again.  Here's the form again, only the action this
time points to form2.cgi.<p>
<hr noshade width=75%>
<form action="http://www.io.com/~kira/form2.cgi" method="POST">
<center><pre>
       Your Name: <input type="text" name="name">
   Email Address: <input type="text" name="email">
             Age: <input type="text" name="age">
  Favorite_Color: <input type="text" name="favorite_color">

</pre>
<input type="submit"><input type="reset">
</form>
</center>
<hr noshade width=75%>
<p>
And that's all there is to it.  If you have problems with the script,
check to be sure you're using the correct path for sendmail.  Also remember
the trick of running the script from the Unix shell - this may point
out errors you might have missed before.<p>
