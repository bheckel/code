<p>That is a very good question, and it goes right to the heart of a very
important and unusual feature of the Perl language, so it'll take a
little while to explain.  Please bear with me through this explanation
of one of Perl's central concepts. </p>

<p>Every Perl expression is in one of two `contexts', either `list
context' or `scalar context', depending on whether it is expected to
produce a list or a scalar.  Many expressions have quite different
behaviors in list context than they do in scalar context.</p>

<p>Here is a typical expression:</p>

<pre>
	EXPRESSION
</pre>

<p>Here it is again, in a list context:</p>

<pre>
	@array = EXPRESSION;   # Expression is expected to produce a list
</pre>

<p>Here is how it looks in a scalar context:</p>

<pre>
	$scalar = EXPRESSION;   # Expression is expected to produce a scalar
</pre>

<p>The values that a particular expression has in these two contexts
might be quite different.  For example, consider this simple
expression:</p>

<pre>
	@q
</pre>

<p>In list context, this produces a list of the items in the array
<tt>@q</tt>, but in scalar context it produces the <em>number</em> of
items in the array <tt>@q</tt>.</p>

<pre>
	@a = @q;    # @q in list context produces a list of items from @q
	$s = @q;    # but in scalar context, it produces the number of items.
</pre>

<p>Similarly, </p>

<pre>
	# Note two very different behaviors of // depending on context

	# Put ('123.45', 'immediately') into @a
	@a = /The amount was \$(\d+\.\d\d)\.  You must pay ([\w\s]+)\./ 

	# Put 1 into $s, put '123.45' into $1, put 'immediately' into $2
	$s = /The amount was \$(\d+\.\d\d)\.  You must pay ([\w\s]+)\./ 
</pre>

<p>The main point here: An expression's behavior can be drastically
different in list context than it is in scalar context.</p>

<p>Now we'll return to your example.</p>

<pre><i>
&gt;     @string_array = reverse(@string_array);
</i></pre>

<p>Here, <tt>reverse</tt> is in list context, because it's being asked
to produce a list to assign to <tt>@string_array</tt>.  In list
context, <tt>reverse</tt> reverses the <em>order</em> of its
arguments, so that the lines come out in the <em>reverse order</em>.
</p>

<p>Then you did</p>

<pre>
&gt;    print(&quot;\n&quot; . reverse(@string_array) . &quot;\n&quot;);
</pre>

<p>Now, here <tt>reverse</tt> is in scalar context, because it is
being asked to produce a scalar value, a string, which will be
concatenated with <tt>\n</tt> on the front and back.  In a scalar
context, <tt>reverse</tt> first concatenates all its arguments, to get
a single string, and then reverses that string.  As you know by
now.</p>

<p>How can you get the behavior you really want?  The <tt>reverse</tt>
here needs to be in a list context.  The argument list of a function
like `print' is always a list context, so if you get rid of the
concatenation operators that are providing scalar context to
`reverse', your problem will go away:</p>

<pre>
	print &quot;\n&quot;, reverse(@string_array), &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>

<p><tt>reverse</tt> is now expected to return a list, which will be inserted
into the list which is passed to <tt>print</tt>.  This is probably more
efficient than what you were trying to do anyway, since <tt>print</tt> can
print out the many strings without bothering to concatenate them
first, as you were doing.</p>

<p>Again, the general rule is:</p>

<blockquote>
	There is no general rule for deducing a function's behavior in
	scalar context from its behavior in list context.
</blockquote>

<p>This is the cause of a lot of common errors.  One mistake you didn't
make, but which we see a lot is something like this:</p>

<pre>
	@a = (reverse(&quot;part&quot;));
</pre>

<p>The programmer was expecting <tt>@a</tt> to get a list containing
<tt>&quot;trap&quot;</tt>, but instead they got a list containing
<tt>&quot;part&quot;</tt> again.  Because <tt>reverse</tt> was in a
list context, it reversed the <em>order</em> of its arguments, instead
of reversing the arguments themselves, and since it only had one
argument, it ended up doing nothing.</p>

<p>Perl has a special operator for just such circumstances.  It's
called <tt>scalar</tt>, and it forces its argument to be evaluated in
scalar context.  The last example should have been written as:</p>

<pre>
	@a = (scalar(reverse(&quot;part&quot;)));
	# @a now contains (&quot;trap&quot;)
</pre>

<p>I hope this clears things up for you.</p>
