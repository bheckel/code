# For this next screen, hit the “auto detect” button to let FairUse Wizard determine what kind of interlacing the DVD contains. It will recommend one, and select it for you automatically.
# Video encodings: Select “XviD.”
# Audio track: English (I don’t think I have ever messed with this one as it’s always been the logical choice for me.)
# Encoding Speed: I've tweaked these settings a few times but mostly I leave this alone and get the same results taking the default.
# MP-3 128kb’s: I don’t mess with this setting, either. You can make it smaller, but MP-3 is already pretty well compressed, so I take the default.
# I don’t select anything around “preferred resolutions,” “rotating the screen,” or “TV Mode.”
# I select a screen resolution of 336X226. Remember: The Palm Treo is 320X320. Stretching the movie to the full size of the screen will not degrade the picture too terribly from this resolution providing you haven’t skimped on megabytes for the length of the movie.
# File size: 200 Megs. This is a pretty safe size for a full-length movie. (I have read that a good rule of thumb is 1.78MB/min of the movie.)
# Output file segments: 1. Also, “Splitting after each chapter” is unchecked, as well as “Defer Processing.”
# Now, hit “Next.”
