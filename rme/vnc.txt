Installed regular v4 vnc first, assigned pw during setup, said ok to ZoneAlarm.

Then installed Palm vnc but said only install Palm part.

Should have done the whole thing with the Palm vnc installer but the
one from realvnc.com seems to be newer than the bundled palm one.

Connect pc via intergate then start palm vnc on treo.

v4 doesn't allow scaling, so now using only the Palm exe's vnc

On PC, make sure firewall is not enabled
F8 to exit fullscreen (or right click vnc, disconnect clients)
