Don't need quotes for multi word after the colon.


 intitle: to find things that exist only in the title of web pages.

 inurl: to find things that exist only in the url of a webpage.
        inurl:06 site:stevemcconnell.com

 intext: to find things that exist only in the body of a webpage.

 inanchor: to find things that exist only in the anchor of a webpage.
           An anchor is the text associated with a link that helps to
           identify it.  
           inanchor:daycare OR babysitter

 site: to isolate a search to just a certain website or domain. This,
       by the way, is a far better way to search the Microsoft site than
       using their built-in search feature.  
       site:microsoft.com "securing windows 98" (good luck)

 link: to find all pages that link to a given site: 
       link:slashdot.org

 cache: to find the cached version of a certain site.  A cache is a
        snapshot copy of the site which is helpful if the site is offline or
        changed from when you saw it last.  
        cache:www.cnn.com/  or  cache:www.cnn.com/newsy.html

 filetype: to find various file types that exist on the Internet.
           This is very powerful when combined with other search options.
           filetype:pdf "nursing education"

 related: to find pages that are related in type/classification to
          the input given. 'related:www.slashdot.org', for example, will yield
          hits like www.userfriendly.org because they are both
          "geek-oriented".  
          related:www.securityfocus.com

 info: to get all Google-related information (cache, stocks, links,
       related, etc.) about a given site.  
       info:www.microsoft.com

 phonebook: to find phone number and address information about people and
            businesses.  To get more specific, just add the city to the query
            as well.  There are three different phonebook related searches
            available - phonebook, rphonebook, and bphonebook.  No spaces
            after the colon!
            phonebook:smith ca 
            bphonebook:round table, fremont
            rphonebook:smith fremont

 stocks: to check stock and other company information for a given company.  
         stocks:CSCO

 define:  definitions
          e.g. http://www.google.com/search?q=define:pty

Conversion -- "80 calories in joules"


Tips
====
Put the most pertinent search terms first.

Repetition matters. Entering a particular search term multiple times will, at
the very least, change the order of your results. In general, the term with
multiple instances (and therefore more weight) will be more prevalent in the
search results.

Case does not matter.  Except for the word OR

Use double quotes when looking for exact phrases.

Do not include words like a, to, and the in your queries; they are omitted by
Google anyway due to how common they are, and don't help your search in any
way. If you really want to use one, add a '+' (plus) to it and it will force
Google to include it in the query.  Also, when using quotes to search for
phrases, these words are not omitted; the entire phrase you entered within the
quotes is searched for.

By default, Google uses the Boolean AND operator when performing searches when
given multiple arguments.

You can use 'OR' to search instead of the default 'AND' by putting an 'OR'
between search terms.  You can also use '|' (the pipe character) as OR.  house
OR car cat | dog

When you perform a query and get your results back, the blue bar located under
the search tabs will say, "Searched _ pages for *your_terms". If *your_term*
was a word with a definition at dictionary.com, the word *your_term* will be a
link to the definition of the word at dictionary.com.

You can group search terms using both the default 'AND' and the 'OR'
operations together.  cats (pets OR wild) plants green (ocean | land)

It is possible to remove results that contain certain words by using the '-'
(minus) sign.  This allows you to filter out results that you know don't
pertain to what you are looking for.  ford mustang -horse

You can use an '*' (asterisk) as a full-word wildcard in a phrase lookup.
This is helpful when you want to fill in gaps in a search phrase with any full
word.  "rule of *"

Give the bookmark a keyword such as "gis". Now, when you type "gis foo" into
the address bar, it goes to this URL, replacing the "%s" in the URL with "foo"
