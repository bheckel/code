1) Open the phone keypad and enter the following: *#*#4636#*#*
 
2) Select 'Phone information'
  
3) Scroll to bottom of page and notice how 'Set preferred network type:' alternates between 'Unknown' and 'WCDMA' [Note: This should normally be set to CDMA auto (PRL)]
   
4) Change to CDMA auto (PRL) and select 'Update' and then scroll up to see an improvement in Signal Strength. Don't get too excited, the improvement is not great but this may be a large part of the battery drain issue.
