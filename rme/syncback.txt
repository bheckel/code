Ubuntu Wine

use
~/Dropbox/Public/misc/computer/SyncBackSE40_Setup.exe

What works
Basic sync functionality. Accepted my license key.

What does not
SyncBack Log will not open from the app but is available:

file:///home/[YOUR USERNAME]/.wine/drive_c/Program%20Files/2BrightSparks/SyncBackSE/[YOUR BACKUP PROFILE NAME]_Log_Page1.html

For example:

file:///home/bheckel/.wine/drive_c/Program%20Files/2BrightSparks/SyncBackSE/code%20on%20Dropbox%20and%20USB_Log_Page1.html

What was not tested
Any advanced synchronization settings

Additional Comments
Only tested SyncbackSE v4.0 per previous tester notes.  Install as Win98.  Crashes/hangs if that Win98 setting isn't changed back to WinXP after installing.
