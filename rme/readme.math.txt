1) I ask: 100 times what number will give me 105?
  
  100 * x = 105
  
        x = 105 / 100

        x = 1.05

2)  Then I ask:  What increase is that over 100%? 

    x - 1 = 1.05 - 1

          = 0.05

          = 5/100

          = 5%

So I have an increase of 5%


E.g. What is the percentage increase from 96MB to 256MB

  1) 96 * x = 256

          x = 256 / 96

          x = 2.67

  2)  x - 1 = 2.67 - 1

            = 1.67 

            = 167/100

            = 167%

Fraction comparison, use lowest common multiplier

      7/10      1/3       5/6
      2*5        3prime   2*3

      2*5*       3        - -     = 30

  7*3/10*3     10*1/10*3  5*5/5*6
  21/30         10/30      25/30

so 1/3, 7/10, 5/6
