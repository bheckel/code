Understanding Object Parents

When working in VBA, it's important to understand the object model for the
application you're using. More specifically, a good knowledge of how various
objects relate to each other can often simplify your coding.  Excel's object
model is a hierarchy - objects are contained in other objects. At the top of
the hierarchy is the application objects (Excel itself). Excel contains other
objects, and these objects contain other objects, and so on. The following
depicts how a Range objects fits into this scheme. 

Application Object (Excel)
    Workbook Object
        Worksheet Object
            Range Object

In the lingo of object-oriented programming, a Range object's parent is the
Worksheet object that contains it. A Worksheet object's parent is the Workbook
that contains the worksheet. And, a Workbook object's parent is the Application
object. 


The SheetName Function

How can this information be put to use? Examine the VBA function below. This
function, which can be used in a worksheet formula, accepts a single argument
(a range) and returns the name of the worksheet that contains the range. It
uses the Parent property of the Range object. The Parent property returns an
object -- the object that contains the range object. 

Function SheetName(ref) As String
    SheetName = ref.Parent.Name
End Function


The WorkbookName Function

The next function, WorkbookName, returns the name of the workbook. Notice that
is uses the Parent property twice - the first Parent property returns a
Worksheet object; the second Parent property returns a Workbook object. 

Function WorkbookName(ref) As String
    WorkbookName = ref.Parent.Parent.Name
End Function


The AppName Function

The function below carries this to the next logical level, accessing the
Parent property three times. This function returns the name of the Application
object. 

Function AppName(ref) As String
 AppName = ref.Parent.Parent.Parent.Name
End Function
