
Here is a nice function for finding a leap year.  The trick is to not only
dividing the year by 4, but also test for division by 100 and 400.

Public Function IsLeapYear(iYear As Integer)
    '-- Check for leap year
    If (iYear Mod 4 = 0) And _
    ((iYear Mod 100 <> 0) Or (iYear Mod 400 = 0)) Then
        IsLeapYear = True
    Else
        IsLeapYear = False
    End If
End Function
