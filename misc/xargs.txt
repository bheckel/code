Consider xargs as a powerful replacement for backquotes.  Normally, xargs
reads from stdin or from a pipe, but it can also be given the output of a
file.  xargs processes many arguments in manageable portions.

Save yourself a lot of typing when you have to perform repetitive
commands on a list of files.  Put the list of files in a text file
with one file per line ie: find . -name version.C > filename
Then have xargs build a command line for each file in the list as 
follows:

$ cat filename |xargs -n 1 cp anotherfile

This will copy anotherfile over all the files listed in
filename one at a time until the end of filename is reached. 

How xargs improves on backticks:

$ ls -ld `find / -print`

might generate an error when the command line is too large, the equivalent
command using xargs will never generate that error:

$ find / -print | xargs ls -ld
