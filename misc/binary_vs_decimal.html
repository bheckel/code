<p>Binary vs. Decimal Measurements</b></u></p>
<p>From http://www.pcguide.com</p>

<p>One of the most confusing problems regarding PC statistics and measurements is the fact
that the computing world has two different definitions for most of its measurement terms.
:^) Capacity measurements are usually expressed in kilobytes (thousands of bytes), in
megabytes (millions of bytes), or gigabytes (billions of bytes). Due to a mathematical
coincidence, however, there are two different meanings for each of these measures.</p>

<p>Computers are digital and <a href="../works/comput_Math.htm">store data using binary
numbers</a>, or powers of two, while humans normally use <em>decimal</em> numbers,
expressed as powers of ten. As it turns out, two to the tenth power, 2^10, is 1,024, which
is very close in value to 1,000 (10^3).&nbsp; Similarly, 2^20 is 1,048,576, which is
approximately 1,000,000 (10^6), and 2^30 is 1,073,741,824, close to 1,000,000,000 (10^9).
When computers and binary numbers first began to be used regularly, computer scientists
noticed this similarity, and for convenience, &quot;hijacked&quot; the abbreviations
normally used for decimal numbers and began applying them to binary numbers. Thus, 2^10
was given the prefix &quot;kilo&quot;, 2^20 was called &quot;mega&quot;, and 2^30
&quot;giga&quot;.</p>

<p>This shorthand worked fairly well when used only by technicians who worked regularly
with computers; they knew what they were talking about, and nobody else really cared. Over
the years however, computers have become mainstream, and the dual notation has led to
quite a bit of confusion and inconsistency. In many areas of the PC, only binary measures
are used. For example, &quot;64 MB of system RAM&quot; always means 64 times 1,048,576
bytes of RAM, never 64,000,000. In other areas, only decimal measures are found--a
&quot;28.8K modem&quot; works at a maximum speed of 28,800 bits per second, not 29,491.</p>

<p>Storage devices however are where the real confusion comes in. Some companies and
software packages use binary megabytes and gigabytes, and some use decimal megabytes and
gigabytes. What's worse is that the percentage discrepancy between the decimal and binary
measures increases as the numbers get larger: there is only a 2.4% difference between a
decimal and a binary kilobyte, which isn't that big of a deal. However, this increases to
around a 5% difference for megabytes, and around 7.5% for gigabytes, which is actually
fairly significant. This is why with today's larger hard disks, more people are starting
to notice the difference between the two measures. Hard disk capacities are always stated
in decimal gigabytes, while most software uses binary. So, someone will buy a &quot;30 GB
hard disk&quot;, partition and format it, and then be told by Windows that the disk is
&quot;27.94 gigabytes&quot; and wonder &quot;where the other 2 gigabytes went&quot;. Well,
the disk <em>is</em> 27.94 gigabytes--27.94 <em>binary</em> gigabytes. The 2 gigabytes
didn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>Another thing to be careful of is converting between binary gigabytes and binary
megabytes. <i>Decimal</i> gigabytes and megabytes differ by a factor of 1,000 but of
course the binary measures differ by 1,024. So this same 30 GB hard disk is 30,000 MB in
decimal terms. But its 27.94 binary gigabytes are equal to 28,610 binary megabytes (27.94
times 1,024).</p>

<p>One final &quot;gotcha&quot; in this area is related to arithmetic done between units
that have different definitions of &quot;mega&quot; or &quot;giga&quot;. For example: most
people would say that the <a href="../../ref/mbsys/buses/types/pci.htm">PCI bus</a> has a
maximum theoretical bandwidth of 133.3 Mbytes/second, because it is 4 bytes wide and runs
at 33.3 MHz. The problem here is that the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;MHz&quot; is 1,000,000;
but the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;Mbytes/second&quot; is 1,048,576. So the bandwidth of the
PCI bus is more properly stated as 127.2 Mbytes/second (4 times 33,333,333 divided by
1,048,576).</p>

<p>There's potential good news regarding this whole binary/decimal conundrum. The <a href="http://www.ieee.org"><em>IEEE</em></a> has proposed a new naming convention for the
binary numbers, to hopefully eliminate some of the confusion. Under this proposal, for
binary numbers the third and fourth letters in the prefix are changed to &quot;bi&quot;,
so &quot;mega&quot; becomes &quot;mebi&quot; for example. Thus, one megabyte would be 10^6
bytes, but one <em>mebibyte</em> would be 2^20 bytes. The abbreviation would become
&quot;1 MiB&quot; instead of &quot;1 MB&quot;. &quot;Mebibyte&quot; sounds goofy, but hey,
I'm sure &quot;byte&quot; did too, 30 years ago. ;^) Here's a summary table showing the
decimal and binary measurements and their abbreviations and values (&quot;bytes&quot; are
shown as an example unit here, but the prefices could apply to any unit of measure):</p>

<p>Only time will tell if this standard, which you can read about <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html"><em>here</em></a>, will catch on--old
habits die hard. I for one will be doing my share though. As I update various portions of
the site, I will be changing places where I used terms such as &quot;kB&quot; and
&quot;MB&quot; for binary numbers into &quot;kiB&quot; and &quot;MiB&quot;. This may be
confusing at first but I think we'll get used to it, and at least it will eliminate much
of the confusion.</p>
