<P>This page is a tutorial of the <I>Structured Query Language </I>(also
known as <B>SQL</B>) and is a pioneering effort on the World Wide Web,
as this is the first comprehensive SQL tutorial available on the Internet.
SQL allows users to access data in relational database management systems,
such as Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, and others,
by allowing users to describe the data the user wishes to see. SQL also
allows users to define the data in a database, and manipulate that data.
This page will describe how to use SQL, and give examples. The SQL used
in this document is &quot;ANSI&quot;, or standard SQL, and no SQL features
of specific database management systems will be discussed until the &quot;Nonstandard
SQL&quot; section. It is recommended that you print this page, so that
you can easily refer back to previous examples.

<P>In a relational database, data is stored in tables. An example table
would relate Social Security Number, Name, and Address: </P>

<P>Now, let's say you want to see the address of each employee. Use the
SELECT statement, like so: </P>

<P><TT>SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address, City, State <BR>
FROM EmployeeAddressTable; </TT></P>

<P>The following is the results of your <I>query</I> of the database: </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >

<P>To explain what you just did, you asked for the all of data in the EmployeeAddressTable,
and specifically, you asked for the <I>columns</I> called FirstName, LastName,
Address, City, and State. Note that column names and table names do not
have spaces...they must be typed as one word; and that the statement ends
with a semicolon (;). The general form for a SELECT statement, retrieving
all of the <I>rows</I> in the table is: </P>

<PRE><TT>SELECT ColumnName, ColumnName, ... 
FROM TableName; </TT>
</PRE>

<P>To get all columns of a table without typing all column names, use:
</P>

<PRE><TT>SELECT *
FROM TableName;</TT>
</PRE>

<P>Each database management system (DBMS) and database software has different
methods for logging in to the database and entering SQL commands; see the
local computer &quot;guru&quot; to help you get onto the system, so that
you can use SQL.

<H4>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Logical Operators"></A>Logical Operators </H4>

<P>There are six logical operators in SQL, and after introducing them,
we'll see how they're used: </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=103>=</TD>

<TD WIDTH=180>Equal</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=103>&lt;&gt; or != (see manual)</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=103>&gt;=</TD>

<TD WIDTH=180>Greater Than or Equal To </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The <I>WHERE </I>clause is used to specify that only certain rows of
the table are displayed, based on the criteria described in that <I>WHERE
clause</I>. It is most easily understood by looking at a couple of examples.</P>

<P>If you wanted to see the EMPLOYEEIDNO's of those making at or over $50,000,
use the following:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE SALARY &gt;= 50000;</TT></P>

<P>Notice that the &gt;= (greater than or equal to) sign is used, as we
wanted to see those who made greater than $50,000, or equal to $50,000,
listed together. This displays:</P>

<P><TT>EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
------------<BR>
010<BR>
105<BR>
152<BR>
215<BR>
244</TT></P>

<P>The <I>WHERE</I> description, SALARY &gt;= 50000, is known as a <I>condition.</I>
The same can be done for text columns:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION = 'Manager';</TT></P>

<P>This displays the ID Numbers of all Managers. Generally, with text columns,
stick to equal to or not equal to conditions, and make sure that any text
that appears in the statement is surrounded by single quotes (').</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Compound Conditions"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>More Complex
Conditions: Compound Conditions</FONT></P>

<P>The <I>AND</I> operator joins two or more conditions, and displays a
row only if that row's data satisfies <B>ALL</B> conditions listed (i.e.
all conditions hold true). For example, to display all staff making over
$40,000, use:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE SALARY &gt; 40000 AND POSITION = 'Staff';</TT></P>

<P>The <I>OR</I> operator joins two or more conditions, but returns a row
if <B>ANY</B> of the conditions listed hold true. To see all those who
make less than $40,000 or have less than $10,000 in benefits, listed together,
use the following query:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE SALARY &lt; 40000 OR BENEFITS &lt; 10000;</TT></P>

<P>AND &amp; OR can be combined, for example:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION = 'Manager' AND SALARY &gt; 60000 OR BENEFITS &gt; 12000;</TT></P>

<P>First, SQL finds the rows where the salary is greater than $60,000 or
the benefits is greater than $12,000, then taking this new list of rows,
SQL then sees if any of these rows satisfies the condition that the Position
column if equal to 'Manager'. Subsequently, SQL only displays this second
new list of rows, as the AND operator forces SQL to only display such rows
satisfying the Position column condition. Also note that the OR&nbsp;operation
is done first.</P>

<P>To generalize this process, SQL performs the OR operation(s) to determine
the rows where the OR operation(s) hold true (remember: any one of the
conditions is true), then these results are used to compare with the AND&nbsp;conditions,
and only display those remaining rows where the conditions joined by the
AND operator hold true.</P>

<P>To perform AND's before OR's, like if you wanted to see a list of managers
or anyone making a large salary (&gt;$50,000) and a large benefit package
(&gt;$10,000), whether he or she is or is not a manager, use parentheses:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION = 'Manager' OR (SALARY &gt; 50000 AND BENEFIT &gt; 10000);</TT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="IN & BETWEEN"></A><B><I>IN &amp; BETWEEN</I></B></P>

<P>An easier method of using compound conditions uses <I>IN</I> or <I>BETWEEN.</I>
For example, if you wanted to list all managers and staff:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION IN ('Manager', 'Staff');</TT></P>

<P>or to list those making greater than or equal to $30,000, but less than
or equal to $50,000, use:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000;</TT></P>

<P>To list everyone not in this range, try:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE SALARY NOT BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000;</TT></P>

<P>Similarly, NOT&nbsp;IN lists all rows excluded from the <I>IN</I> list.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Using LIKE"></A><B>Using<I> LIKE</I></B></P>

<P>Look at the EmployeeStatisticsTable, and say you wanted to see all people
whose last names started with &quot;L&quot;; try:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT EMPLOYEEIDNO<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEEADDRESSTABLE<BR>
WHERE LASTNAME&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;'L%';</TT></P>

<P>The percent sign (%) is used to represent any possible character (number,
letter, or punctuation) or set of characters that might appear after the
&quot;L&quot;. To find those people with LastName's ending in &quot;L&quot;,
use '%L', or if you wanted the &quot;L&quot; in the middle of the word,
try '%L%'. The '%' can be used for any characters, in that relative position
to the given characters. NOT&nbsp;LIKE displays rows not fitting the given
description. Other possiblities of using LIKE, or any of these discussed
conditionals, are available, though it depends on what DBMS you are using;
as usual, consult a manual or your system manager or administrator for
the available features on your system, or just to make sure that what you
are trying to do is available and allowed. This disclaimer holds for the
features of SQL that will be discussed below. This section is just to give
you an idea of the possibilities of queries that can be written in SQL.

<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Joins"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Joins</FONT></B></P>

<P>In this section, we will only discuss <I>inner</I> joins, and <I>equijoins</I>,
as in general, they are the most useful. For more information, try the
SQL links at the bottom of the page.</P>

<P>Good database design suggests that each table lists data only about
a single <I>entity</I>, and detailed information can be obtained in a relational
database, by using additional tables, and by using a <I>join</I>.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Keys"></A><B>Keys</B></P>

<P>First, let's discuss the concept of <I>keys</I>. A <I>primary key</I>
is a column or set of columns that uniquely idenifies the rest of the data
in any given row. For example, in the AntiqueOwners table, the OwnerID
column uniquely identifies that row. This means two things: no two rows
can have the same OwnerID, and, even if two owners have the same first
and last names, the OwnerID&nbsp;column ensures that the two owners will
not be confused with each other, because the unique OwnerID column will
be used throughout the database to track the owners, rather than the names.</P>

<P>A<I> foreign key</I> is a column in a table where that column is a primary
key of another table, which means that any data in a foreign key column
must have corresponding data in the other table where that column is the
primary key. In DBMS-speak, this correspondence is known as <I>referential
integrity</I>. For example, in the Antiques table, both the BuyerID and
SellerID are foreign keys to the primary key of the AntiqueOwners table
(OwnerID; for purposes of argument, one has to be an Antique Owner before
one can buy or sell any items), as, in both tables, the ID rows are used
to identify the owners or buyers and sellers, and that the OwnerID is the
primary key of the AntiqueOwners table. In other words, all of this &quot;ID&quot;
data is used to refer to the owners, buyers, or sellers of antiques, themselves,
without having to use the actual names.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Performing a Join"></A><B>Performing a Join</B></P>

<P>The purpose of these <I>keys</I> is so that data can be related across
tables, without having to repeat data in every table--this is the power
of relational databases. For example, you can find the names of those who
bought a chair without having to list the full name of the buyer in the
Antiques table...you can get the name by relating those who bought a chair
with the names in the AntiqueOwners table through the use of the OwnerID,
which <I>relates</I> the data in the two tables. To find the names of those
who bought a chair, use the following query:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT OWNERLASTNAME, OWNERFIRSTNAME<BR>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS, ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE BUYERID = OWNERID AND ITEM = 'Chair';</TT></P>

<P>Note the following about this query...notice that both tables involved
in the relation are listed in the FROM clause of the statement. In the
WHERE clause, first notice that the ITEM = 'Chair' part restricts the listing
to those who have bought (and in this example, thereby owns) a chair. Secondly,
notice how the ID columns are related from one table to the next by use
of the BUYERID = OWNERID clause. Only where ID's match across tables and
the item purchased is a chair (because of the AND), will the names from
the AntiqueOwners table be listed. Because the joining condition used an
equal sign, this join is called an <I>equijoin</I>. The result of this
query is two names: Smith, Bob &amp; Fowler, Sam.</P>

<P><I>Dot notation</I> refers to prefixing the table names to column names,
to avoid ambiguity, as such:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERLASTNAME, ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERFIRSTNAME<BR>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS, ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE ANTIQUES.BUYERID = ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERID AND ANTIQUES.ITEM = 'Chair';</TT></P>

<P>As the column names are different in each table, however, this wasn't
necessary.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Eliminating Duplicates"></A><B><I>DISTINCT</I>
and Eliminating Duplicates</B></P>

<P>Let's say that you want to list the ID and names of <B>only</B> those
people who have sold an antique. Obviously, you want a list where each
seller is only listed once--you don't want to know how many antiques a
person sold, just the fact that this person sold one (for counts, see the
Aggregate Function section below). This means that you will need to tell
SQL to eliminate duplicate sales rows, and just list each person only once.
To do this, use the <I>DISTINCT</I> keyword.</P>

<P>First, we will need an equijoin to the AntiqueOwners table to get the
detail data of the person's LastName and FirstName. However, keep in mind
that since the SellerID column in the Antiques table is a foreign key to
the AntiqueOwners table, a seller will only be listed if there is a row
in the AntiqueOwners table listing the ID and names. We also want to eliminate
multiple occurences of the SellerID in our listing, so we use <I>DISTINCT
</I><B>on the column where the repeats may occur.</B></P>

<P>To throw in one more twist, we will also want the list alphabetized
by LastName, then by FirstName (on a LastName tie), then by OwnerID (on
a LastName and FirstName tie). Thus, we will use the <I>ORDER BY</I> clause:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT DISTINCT SELLERID, OWNERLASTNAME, OWNERFIRSTNAME<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES, ANTIQUEOWNERS<BR>
WHERE SELLERID = OWNERID<BR>
ORDER BY OWNERLASTNAME, OWNERFIRSTNAME, OWNERID</TT></P>

<P>In this example, since everyone has sold an item, we will get a listing
of all of the owners, in alphabetical order by last name. For future reference
(and in case anyone asks), this type of join is considered to be in the
category of <I>inner joins.</I></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Aliases & In/Subqueries"></A><B>Aliases &amp;
<I>In</I>/Subqueries</B></P>

<P>In this section, we will talk about <I>Aliases</I>, <I>In</I> and the
use of subqueries, and how these can be used in a 3-table example. First,
look at this query which prints the last name of those owners who have
placed an order and what the order is, only listing those orders which
can be filled (that is, there is a buyer who owns that ordered item):</P>

<P><TT>SELECT&nbsp;OWN.OWNERLASTNAME Last Name, ORD.ITEMDESIRED Item Ordered<BR>
FROM ORDERS ORD, ANTIQUEOWNERS OWN<BR>
WHERE ORD.OWNERID = OWN.OWNERID<BR>
AND ORD.ITEMDESIRED IN</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT ITEM<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES);</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>This gives:</P>

<P><TT>Last Name Item Ordered<BR>
--------- ------------<BR>
Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table<BR>
Smith&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desk<BR>
Akins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chair<BR>
Lawson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirror</TT></P>

<P>There are several things to note about this query:</P>

<OL>
<LI>First, the &quot;Last Name&quot; and &quot;Item Ordered&quot; in the
Select lines gives the headers on the report.</LI>

<LI>The OWN &amp; ORD are aliases; these are new names for the two tables
listed in the FROM clause that are used as prefixes for all dot notations
of column names in the query (see above). This eliminates ambiguity, especially
in the equijoin WHERE clause where both tables have the column named OwnerID,
and the dot notation tells SQL that we are talking about two different
OwnerID's from the two different tables.</LI>

<LI>Note that the Orders table is listed first in the FROM clause; this
makes sure listing is done off of that table, and the AntiqueOwners table
is only used for the detail information (Last Name).</LI>

<LI>Most importantly, the AND in the WHERE clause forces the In Subquery
to be invoked (&quot;= ANY&quot; or &quot;= SOME&quot; are two equivalent
uses of IN). What this does is, the subquery is performed, returning all
of the Items owned from the Antiques table, as there is no WHERE clause.
Then, for a row from the Orders table to be listed, the ItemDesired must
be in that returned list of Items owned from the Antiques table, thus listing
an item only if the order can be filled from another owner. You can think
of it this way: the subquery returns a <I>set</I> of Items from which each
ItemDesired in the Orders table is compared; the In condition is true only
if the ItemDesired is in that returned set from the Antiques table.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Whew! That's enough on the topic of complex SELECT queries for now.
Now on to other SQL statements. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Miscellaneous SQL&nbsp;Statements</FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="Aggregate Functions"></A><B>Aggregate Functions</B></P>

<P>I will discuss five important <I>aggregate functions</I>: SUM, AVG,
MAX, MIN, and COUNT. They are called aggregate functions because they summarize
the results of a query, rather than listing all of the rows. </P>

<OL>
<LI>SUM () gives the total of all the rows, satisfying any conditions,
of the given column, where the given column is numeric.</LI>

<LI>AVG () gives the average of the given column.</LI>

<LI>MAX&nbsp;() gives the largest figure in the given column.</LI>

<LI>MIN () gives the smallest figure in the given column.</LI>

<LI>COUNT(*) gives the number of rows satisfying the conditions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Looking at the tables at the top of the document, let's look at three
examples:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT SUM(SALARY), AVG(SALARY)<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE;</TT></P>

<P>This query shows the total of all salaries in the table, and the average
salary of all of the entries in the table.</P>

<P><TT>SELECT MIN(BENEFITS)<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION = 'Manager';</TT></P>

<P>This query gives the smallest figure of the Benefits column, of the
employees who are Managers, which is 12500.</P>

<P><TT>SELECT COUNT(*)<BR>
FROM EMPLOYEESTATISTICSTABLE<BR>
WHERE POSITION = 'Staff';</TT></P>

<P>This query tells you how many employees have Staff status (3).</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Views"></A><B>Views</B></P>

<P>In SQL, you might (check your DBA) have access to create views for yourself.
What a view does is to allow you to assign the results of a query to a
new, personal table, that you can use in other queries, where this new
table is given the view name in your FROM clause. When you access a view,
the query that is defined in your view creation statement is performed
(generally), and the results of that query look just like another table
in the query that you wrote invoking the view. For example, to create a
view:</P>

<P><TT>CREATE VIEW ANTVIEW AS SELECT&nbsp;ITEMDESIRED&nbsp;FROM ORDERS;</TT></P>

<P>Now, write a query using this view as a table, where the table is just
a listing of all Items Desired from the Orders table:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT SELLERID<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES, ANTVIEW<BR>
WHERE ITEMDESIRED = ITEM;</TT></P>

<P>This query shows all SellerID's from the Antiques table where the Item
in that table happens to appear in the Antview view, which is just all
of the Items Desired in the Orders table. The listing is generated by going
through the Antique Items one-by-one until there's a match with the Antview
view. Views can be used to restrict database access, as well as, in this
case, simplify a complex query.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Creating New Tables"></A><B>Creating New Tables</B></P>

<P>All tables within a database must be created at some point in time...let's
see how we would create the Orders table:</P>

<P><TT>CREATE TABLE ORDERS<BR>
(OWNERID INTEGER NOT NULL,<BR>
ITEMDESIRED CHAR(40) NOT NULL);</TT></P>

<P>This statement gives the table name and tells the DBMS about each column
in the table. <B><I>Please note</I></B> that this statement uses generic
data types, and that the data types might be different, depending on what
DBMS you are using. As usual, check local listings. Some common generic
data types are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Char(x) - A column of characters, where x is a number designating the
maximum number of characters allowed (maximum length) in the column.</LI>

<LI>Integer - A column of whole numbers, positive or negative.</LI>

<LI>Decimal(x, y) - A column of decimal numbers, where x is the maximum
length in digits of the decimal numbers in this column, and y is the maximum
number of digits allowed after the decimal point. The maximum (4,2) number
would be 99.99.</LI>

<LI>Date - A date column in a DBMS-specific format.</LI>

<LI>Logical - A column that can hold only two values: TRUE&nbsp;or FALSE.</LI>
</UL>

<P>One other note, the NOT&nbsp;NULL means that the column must have a
value in each row. If NULL was used, that column may be left empty in a
given row.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Altering Tables"></A><B>Altering Tables</B></P>

<P>Let's add a column to the Antiques table to allow the entry of the price
of a given Item:</P>

<P><TT>ALTER TABLE ANTIQUES ADD (PRICE DECIMAL(8,2) NULL);</TT></P>

<P>The data for this new column can be updated or inserted as shown later.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Adding Data"></A><B>Adding Data</B></P>

<P>To insert rows into a table, do the following:</P>

<P><TT>INSERT INTO ANTIQUES VALUES (21, 01, 'Ottoman', 200.00);</TT></P>

<P>This inserts the data into the table, as a new row, column-by-column,
in the pre-defined order. Instead, let's change the order and leave Price
blank:</P>

<P><TT>INSERT INTO ANTIQUES (BUYERID, SELLERID, ITEM)<BR>
VALUES (01, 21, 'Ottoman');</TT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Deleting Data"></A><B>Deleting Data</B></P>

<P>Let's delete this new row back out of the database:</P>

<P><TT>DELETE FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE ITEM = 'Ottoman';</TT></P>

<P>But if there is another row that contains 'Ottoman', that row will be
deleted also. Let's delete all rows (one, in this case) that contain the
specific data we added before:</P>

<P><TT>DELETE FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE ITEM = 'Ottoman' AND BUYERID = 01 AND SELLERID = 21;</TT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Updating Data"></A><B>Updating Data</B></P>

<P>Let's update a Price into a row that doesn't have a price listed yet:</P>

<P><TT>UPDATE ANTIQUES SET PRICE = 500.00 WHERE ITEM = 'Chair';</TT></P>

<P>This sets all Chair's Prices to 500.00. As shown above, more WHERE conditionals,
using AND, must be used to limit the updating to more specific rows. Also,
additional columns may be set by separating equal statements with commas.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Miscellaneous Topics</FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="Indexes"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Indexes</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Indexes allow a DBMS to access data quicker (<I>please note:</I> this
feature is nonstandard/not available on all systems). The system creates
this internal data structure (the index) which causes selection of rows,
when the selection is based on indexed columns, to occur faster. This index
tells the DBMS where a certain row is in the table given an indexed-column
value, much like a book index tells you what page a given word appears.
Let's create an index for the OwnerID in the AntiqueOwners column:</P>

<P><TT>CREATE INDEX OID_IDX ON ANTIQUEOWNERS (OWNERID);</TT></P>

<P>Now on the names:</P>

<P><TT>CREATE INDEX NAME_IDX ON ANTIQUEOWNERS (OWNERLASTNAME, OWNERFIRSTNAME);</TT></P>

<P>To get rid of an index, drop it:</P>

<P><TT>DROP INDEX OID_IDX;</TT></P>

<P>By the way, you can also &quot;drop&quot;&nbsp;a table, as well (careful!--that
means that your table is deleted). In the second example, the index is
kept on the two columns, aggregated together--strange behavior might occur
in this situation...check the manual before performing such an operation.</P>

<P>Some DBMS's do not enforce primary keys; in other words, the uniqueness
of a column is not enforced automatically. What that means is, if, for
example, I tried to insert another row into the AntiqueOwners table with
an OwnerID of 02, some systems will allow me to do that, even though, we
do not, as that column is supposed to be unique to that table (every row
value is supposed to be different). One way to get around that is to create
a unique index on the column that we want to be a primary key, to force
the system to enforce prohibition of duplicates:</P>

<P><TT>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX OID_IDX ON ANTIQUEOWNERS (OWNERID);</TT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="GROUP BY & HAVING"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>GROUP
BY &amp; HAVING</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>One special use of GROUP&nbsp;BY is to associate an aggregate function
(especially COUNT; counting the number of rows in each group) with groups
of rows. First, assume that the Antiques table has the Price column, and
each row has a value for that column. We want to see the price of the most
expensive item bought by each owner. We have to tell SQL to <I>group</I>
each owner's purchases, and tell us the maximum purchase price:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT BUYERID, MAX(PRICE)<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
GROUP BY BUYERID;</TT></P>

<P>Now, say we only want to see the maximum purchase price if the purchase
is over $1000, so we use the HAVING clause:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT BUYERID, MAX(PRICE)<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
GROUP BY BUYERID<BR>
HAVING PRICE &gt; 1000;</TT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="More Subqueries"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>More
Subqueries</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Another common usage of subqueries involve the use of logical operators
to allow a Where condition to include the Select output of a subquery.
First, list the buyers who purchased an expensive item (the Price of the
item is $100 greater than the average price of all items purchased):</P>

<P><TT>SELECT OWNERID<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE PRICE &gt;</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT AVG(PRICE) + 100<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES);</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>The subquery calculates the average Price, plus $100, and using that
figure, an OwnerID is printed for every item costing over that figure.
One could use DISTINCT&nbsp;OWNERID, to eliminate duplicates.</P>

<P>List the Last Names of those in the AntiqueOwners table, ONLY if they
have bought an item:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT OWNERLASTNAME<BR>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS<BR>
WHERE OWNERID =</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT DISTINCT BUYERID<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES);</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>The subquery returns a list of buyers, and the Last Name is printed
for an Antique Owner if and only if the Owner's ID appears in the subquery
list (sometimes called a <I>candidate list</I>).</P>

<P>For an Update example, we know that the gentleman who bought the bookcase
has the wrong First Name in the database...it should be John:</P>

<P><TT>UPDATE ANTIQUEOWNERS<BR>
SET OWNERFIRSTNAME = 'John'<BR>
WHERE OWNERID =</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT BUYERID<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE ITEM = 'Bookcase');</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>First, the subquery finds the BuyerID for the person(s) who bought the
Bookcase, then the outer query updates his First Name.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="EXISTS & ALL"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>EXISTS
&amp; ALL</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>EXISTS uses a subquery as a condition, where the condition is True if
the subquery returns any rows, and False if the subquery does not return
any rows; this is a nonintuitive feature with few unique uses. However,
if a prospective customer wanted to see the list of Owners only if the
shop dealt in Chairs, try:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT OWNERFIRSTNAME, OWNERLASTNAME<BR>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS<BR>
WHERE EXISTS</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT *<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE ITEM = 'Chair');</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>If there are any Chairs in the Antiques column, the subquery would return
a row or rows, making the EXISTS clause true, causing SQL to list the Antique
Owners. If there had been no Chairs, no rows would have been returned by
the outside query.</P>

<P>ALL is another unusual feature, as ALL queries can usually be done with
different, and possibly simpler methods; let's take a look at an example
query:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT BUYERID, ITEM<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE PRICE &gt;= ALL</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT PRICE<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES);</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>This will return the largest priced item (or more than one item if there
is a tie), and its buyer. The subquery returns a list of all Prices in
the Antiques table, and the outer query goes through each row of the Antiques
table, and if its Price is greater than or equal to every (or ALL) Prices
in the list, it is listed, giving the highest priced Item. The reason &quot;&gt;=&quot;
must be used is that the highest priced item will be equal to the highest
price on the list, because this Item is in the Price list.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="UNION & Outer Joins"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>UNION
&amp; Outer Joins</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>There are occasions where you might want to see the results of multiple
queries together, combining their output; use UNION. To merge the output
of the following two queries, displaying the ID's of all Buyers, plus all
those who have an Order placed:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT BUYERID<BR>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS<BR>
UNION<BR>
SELECT OWNERID<BR>
FROM ORDERS;</TT></P>

<P>Notice that SQL requires that the Select list (of columns) must match,
column-by-column, in data type. In this case BuyerID and OwnerID are of
the same data type (integer). Also notice that SQL does automatic duplicate
elimination when using UNION (as if they were two &quot;sets&quot;); in
single queries, you have to use DISTINCT.</P>

<P>The <I>outer join</I> is used when a join query is &quot;united&quot;
with the rows not included in the join, and are especially useful if constant
text &quot;flags&quot; are included. First, look at the query:</P>

<P><TT>SELECT OWNERID, 'is in both Orders &amp; Antiques'<BR>
FROM ORDERS, ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE OWNERID = BUYERID<BR>
UNION<BR>
SELECT BUYERID, 'is in Antiques only'<BR>
FROM ANTIQUES<BR>
WHERE BUYERID NOT IN</TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT>(SELECT OWNERID<BR>
FROM ORDERS);</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>The first query does a join to list any owners who are in both tables,
and putting a tag line after the ID repeating the quote. The UNION merges
this list with the next list. The second list is generated by first listing
those ID's not in the Orders table, thus generating a list of ID's excluded
from the join query. Then, each row in the Antiques table is scanned, and
if the BuyerID is not in this exclusion list, it is listed with its quoted
tag. There might be an easier way to make this list, but it's difficult
to generate the informational quoted strings of text.</P>

<P>This concept is useful in situations where a primary key is related
to a foreign key, but the foreign key value for some primary keys is NULL.
For example, in one table, the primary key is a salesperson, and in another
table is customers, with their salesperson listed in the same row. However,
if a salesperson has no customers, that person's name won't appear in the
customer table. The outer join is used if the listing of <B>all</B> salespersons
is to be printed, listed with their customers, whether the salesperson
has a customer or not--that is, no customer is printed (a logical NULL
value) if the salesperson has no customers, but is in the salespersons
table. Otherwise, the salesperson will be listed with each customer.</P>

SQL Questions--Advanced Topics (see FAQ link for several more)</FONT></I></B></P>

<OL>
<LI>Why can't I just ask for the first three rows in a table? --Because
in relational databases, rows are inserted in no particular order, that
is, the system inserts them in an arbitrary order; so, you can only request
rows using valid SQL features, like ORDER&nbsp;BY, etc.</LI>

<LI>What is this DDL and DML I hear about? --DDL (Data Definition Language)
refers to (in SQL) to the Create Table statement...DML (Data Manipulation
Language) refers to the Select, Update, Insert, and Delete statements.</LI>

<LI>Aren't database tables just files? --Well, DBMS's store data in files
declared by system managers before new tables are created (on large systems),
but the system stores the data in a special format, and may spread data
from one table over several files. In the database world, a set of files
created for a database is called a <I>tablespace</I>. In general, on small
systems, everything about a database (definitions and all table data) is
kept in one file.</LI>

<LI>(Related question) Aren't database tables just like spreadsheets? --No,
for two reasons. First, spreadsheets can have data in a cell, but a cell
is more than just a row-column-intersection. Depending on your spreadsheet
software, a cell might also contain formulas and formatting, which database
tables cannot have (currently). Secondly, spreadsheet cells are often dependent
on the data in other cells. In databases, &quot;cells&quot; are independent,
except that columns are logically related (hopefully; together a row of
columns describe an entity), and, other than primary key and foreign key
constraints, each row in a table in independent from one another.</LI>

<LI>What is <I>normalization</I>? --Normalization is a technique of database
design that suggests that certain criteria be used when constructing a
table layout (deciding what columns each table will have, and creating
the key structure), where the idea is to eliminate redundancy of non-key
data across tables. Normalization is usually referred to in terms of <I>forms</I>,
and I will introduce only the first three, even though it is somewhat common
to use other, more advanced forms (fourth, fifth, Boyce-Codd; see documentation).
<BR>
<BR>
<I>First Normal Form</I> refers to moving data into separate tables where
the data in each table is of a similar type, and by giving each table a
primary key. <BR>
<BR>
Putting data in <I>Second Normal Form</I> involves taking out data off
to other tables that is only dependent of a part of the key. For example,
if I had left the names of the Antique Owners in the items table, that
would not be in second normal form because that data would be redundant;
the name would be repeated for each item owned, so the names were placed
in their own table. The names themselves don't have anything to do with
the items, only the identities of the buyers and sellers. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Third Normal Form</I> involves getting rid of anything in the tables
that doesn't depend solely on the primary key. Only include information
that is dependent on the key, and move off data to other tables that are
independent of the primary key, and create a primary keys for the new tables.
<BR>
<BR>
There is some redundancy to each form, and if data is in <I>3NF </I>(shorthand
for 3rd normal form), it is already in <I>1NF </I>and <I>2NF</I>. In terms
of data design then, arrange data so that any non-primary key columns are
dependent only on the <I>whole primary key</I>. If you take a look at the
sample database, you will see that the way then to navigate through the
database is through joins using common key columns. <BR>
<BR>
Two other important points in database design are using good, consistent,
logical, full-word names for the tables and columns, and the use of full
words in the database itself. On the last point, my database is lacking,
as I use numeric codes for identification. It is usually best, if possible,
to come up with keys that are, by themselves, self-explanatory; for example,
a better key would be the first four letters of the last name and first
initial of the owner, like JONEB for Bill Jones (or for tiebreaking purposes,
add numbers to the end to differentiate two or more people with similar
names, so you could try JONEB1, JONEB2, etc.).</LI>

<LI>What is the difference between a <I>single-row query</I> and a <I>multiple-row
query</I> and why is it important to know the difference? --First, to cover
the obvious, a single-row query is a query that returns one row as its
result, and a multiple-row query is a query that returns more than one
row as its result. Whether a query returns one row or more than one row
is entirely dependent on the design (or <I>schema</I>) of the tables of
the database. As query-writer, you must be aware of the schema, be sure
to include enough conditions, and structure your SQL statement properly,
so that you will get the desired result (either one row or multiple rows).
For example, if you wanted to be sure that a query of the AntiqueOwners
table returned only one row, consider an equal condition of the primary
key-column, OwnerID.<BR>
<BR>
Three reasons immediately come to mind as to why this is important. First,
getting multiple rows when you were expecting only one, or vice-versa,
may mean that the query is erroneous, that the database is incomplete,
or simply, you learned something new about your data. Second, if you are
using an update or delete statement, you had better be sure that the statement
that you write performs the operation on the desired row (or rows)...or
else, you might be deleting or updating more rows than you intend. Third,
any queries written in Embedded SQL must be carefully thought out as to
the number of rows returned. If you write a single-row query, only one
SQL statement may need to be performed to complete the programming logic
required. If your query, on the other hand, returns multiple rows, you
will have to use the Fetch statement, and quite probably, some sort of
looping structure in your program will be required to iterate processing
on each returned row of the query.</LI>

<LI>What are <I>relationships?</I> --Another design question...the term
&quot;relationships&quot; usually refers to the relationships among primary
and foreign keys between tables. This concept is important because when
the tables of a relational database are designed, these relationships must
be defined because they determine which columns are or are not primary
or foreign keys. You may have heard of an <B>Entity-Relationship Diagram</B>,
which is a graphical view of tables in a database schema, with lines connecting
related columns across tables. See some of the sites below in regard to
this topic, as there are many different ways of drawing E-R diagrams. Instead,
let's look at each kind of relationship...<BR>
<BR>
A <I>One-to-one relationship</I> means that you have a primary key column
that is related to a foreign key column, and that for every primary key
value, there is <B>one</B> foreign key value. For example, in the first
example, the EmployeeAddressTable, we add an EmployeeIDNo column. Then,
the EmployeeAddressTable is related to the EmployeeStatisticsTable (second
example table) by means of that EmployeeIDNo. Specifically, each employee
in the EmployeeAddressTable <B>has</B> statistics (one row of data) in
the EmployeeStatisticsTable. Even though this is a contrived example, this
is a &quot;1-1&quot; relationship. Also notice the &quot;has&quot; in bold...when
expressing a relationship, it is important to describe the relationship
with a verb.<BR>
<BR>
The other two kinds of relationships may or may not use logical primary
key and foreign key constraints...it is strictly a call of the designer.
The first of these is the <I>one-to-many relationship</I> (&quot;1-M&quot;).
This means that for every column value in one table, there is <B>one or
more</B> related values in another table. Key constraints may be added
to the design, or possibly just the use of some sort of identifier column
may be used to establish the relationship. An example would be that for
every OwnerID in the AntiqueOwners table, there are one or more (zero is
permissible too) Items <B>bought</B> in the Antiques table (verb: buy).<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the <I>many-to-many relationship</I> (&quot;M-M&quot;) does not
involve keys generally, and usually involves idenifying columns. The unusual
occurence of a &quot;M-M&quot; means that one column in one table is related
to another column in another table, and for every value of one of these
two columns, there are one or more related values in the corresponding
column in the other table (and vice-versa), or more a common possibility,
two tables have a 1-M relationship to each other (two relationships, one
1-M going each way). A [bad] example of the more common situation would
be if you had a job assignment database, where one table held one row for
each employee and a job assignment, and another table held one row for
each job with one of the assigned employees. Here, you would have multiple
rows for each employee in the first table, one for each job assignment,
and multiple rows for each job in the second table, one for each employee
assigned to the project. These tables have a M-M: each employee in the
first table <B>has</B> many job assignments from the second table, and
each job <B>has</B> many employees assigned to it from the first table.
This is the tip of the iceberg on this topic...see the links below for
more information.</LI>

<LI>What are some important nonstandard SQL features (extremely common
question)? --Well, see the next section...</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="Nonstandard SQL"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Nonstandard
SQL...&quot;check local listings&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>INTERSECT&nbsp;and MINUS are like the UNION&nbsp;statement, except
that INTERSECT produces rows that appear in both queries, and MINUS produces
rows that result from the first query, but not the second.</LI>

<LI>Report Generation Features: the COMPUTE&nbsp;clause is placed at the
end of a query to place the result of an aggregate function at the end
of a listing, like <TT>COMPUTE SUM (PRICE); </TT>Another option is to use
break logic: define a break to divide the query results into groups based
on a column, like <TT>BREAK ON BUYERID</TT>. Then, to produce a result
after the listing of a group, use <TT>COMPUTE SUM OF PRICE ON BUYERID</TT>.
If, for example, you used all three of these clauses (BREAK first, COMPUTE
on break second, COMPUTE overall sum third), you would get a report that
grouped items by their BuyerID, listing the sum of Prices after each group
of a BuyerID's items, then, after all groups are listed, the sum of all
Prices is listed, all with SQL-generated headers and lines.</LI>

<LI>In addition to the above listed aggregate functions, some DBMS's allow
more functions to be used in Select lists, except that these functions
(some character functions allow multiple-row results) are to be used with
an individual value (not groups), on <I>single-row queries. </I>The functions
are to be used only on appropriate data types, also. Here are some <B>Mathematical

<P>Here are the general forms of the statements discussed in this tutorial,
plus some extra important ones (explanations given). <B>REMEMBER</B> that
all of these statements may or may not be available on your system, so
check documentation regarding availability:</P>

<P><TT><B>ALTER&nbsp;TABLE </B>&lt;TABLE NAME&gt; ADD|DROP|MODIFY (COLUMN
SPECIFICATION[S]...see Create Table); </TT>--allows you to add or delete
a column or columns from a table, or change the specification (data type,
etc.) on an existing column; this statement is also used to change the
physical specifications of a table (how a table is stored, etc.), but these
definitions are DBMS-specific, so read the documentation. Also, these physical
specifications are used with the Create Table statement, when a table is
first created. In addition, only one option can be performed per Alter
Table statement--either add, drop, <B>OR </B>modify in a single statement.</P>

<P><TT><B>COMMIT</B>;</TT> --makes changes made to some database systems
permanent (since the last COMMIT; known as a <I>transaction</I>)</P>

include the following possibilities (automatically enforced by the DBMS;
failure causes an error to be generated):</P>

<OL>
<LI>NULL or NOT&nbsp;NULL (see above)</LI>

<LI>UNIQUE enforces that no two rows will have the same value for this

<LI>PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY tells the database that this column is the primary
key column (only used if the key is a one column key, otherwise a PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY
(column, column, ...) statement appears after the last column definition.</LI>

<LI>CHECK allows a condition to be checked for when data in that column
is updated or inserted; for example, <TT>CHECK (PRICE &gt; 0)</TT> causes
the system to check that the Price column is greater than zero before accepting
the value...sometimes implemented as the CONSTRAINT statement.</LI>

<LI>DEFAULT inserts the default value into the database if a row is inserted
without that column's data being inserted; for example, <TT>BENEFITS INTEGER
DEFAULT = 10000</TT></LI>

<LI>FOREIGN KEY works the same as Primary Key, but is followed by: <TT>REFERENCES
&lt;TABLE NAME&gt; (&lt;COLUMN NAME&gt;)</TT>, which refers to the referential
primary key.</LI>
