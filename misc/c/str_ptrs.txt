Programmers Question of the Week - January 2000 - 1
Subject Area: C 

Sample Code: 

char buf1[100];
char buf2[100]; 
char *strptr1;
char *strptr2;

strcpy(buf1, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz");
strcpy(buf2, "Hello");

strptr1 = buf1 + 6;
strcpy(strptr1, buf2);

strptr2 = (strptr1 + 8);
strncpy(strptr2, buf2, 5);

printf("%s\n", buf1); 

Question:
 Given the sample code above, which of the following string values will be
 printed? 
1.
 abcdefHello 
2.
 abcdefHellolmnHellotuvwxyz 
3.
 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
4.
 HellolmnHellotuvwxyz 
5.
 ghijklmnHellotuvwxyz 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Correct Answer: 1.  A null is written after the word Hello when it is copied
 using strcpy. Any characters after the null are not printed.  This question
 tests your understanding of string handling, character pointers, null
 termination for strings, and the strcpy function which are all essential for
 writing code to work with text in C.

The sample code does the following:

Creates two buffers and pointers.  
  char buf1[100];
  char buf2[100]; 
  char *strptr1;
  char *strptr2;

Copies the alphabet into the first buffer and the word hello into the second.  
  strcpy(buf1, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz");
  strcpy(buf2, "Hello");

Sets strptr1 to point to the seventh character of the first buffer, which
would be pointing to the letter g.
  strptr1 = buf1 + 6;

Copies the word Hello from the second buffer into the first buffer starting
where the letter g is. This will overwrite the letters ghijk with the letters
to Hello, but it also writes a null character ('\0') over the l.  
  strcpy(strptr1, buf2);

Sets strptr2 to point to the 15th character of the first buffer, which would
be pointing to the letter o.  
  strptr2 = (strptr1 + 8);

Copies the first five characters from the second buffer into the first buffer.
This will overwrite the letters opqr with the letters Hell, but in this case
no null character is written.  The contents of the first buffer is printed,
which will print the characters until the first null character. 
  strncpy(strptr2, buf2, 5);
