>Hey!  Socket programming got you down?  Is this stuff just a
little too difficult to figure out from the <B
CLASS="command"
>man</B

pages?  You want to do cool Internet programming, but you don't have
time to wade through a gob of <TT
CLASS="type"

>s trying to figure out
if you have to call <TT
CLASS="function"
>bind()</TT

<TT
CLASS="function"
>connect()</TT
>, etc., etc.</P
><P
>Well, guess what!  I've already done this nasty business, and I'm
dying to share the information with everyone!  You've come to the right
place.  This document should give the average competent C programmer the
edge s/he needs to get a grip on this networking noise.</P

>When compiling for Solaris or SunOS, you need to specify some
extra command-line switches for linking in the proper libraries.  In
order to do this, simply add "<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>-lnsl -lsocket
-lresolv</TT
>" to the end of the compile command, like
so:</P

"<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>-lxnet</TT

line.  I don't know what that does, exactly, but some people seem to
need it.</P
><P
>Another place that you might find problems is in the call to
<TT

>setsockopt()</TT

my Linux box, so instead of:</P

><P
>I have a particular dislike for Windows, and encourage you to try
Linux, BSD, or Unix instead.  That being said, you can still use this
stuff under Windows.</P
><P
>First, ignore pretty much all of the system header files I mention
in here.  All you need to include is:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

>&#13;    #include &#60;winsock.h&#62; 
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Wait!  You also have to make a call to
<TT
CLASS="function"
>WSAStartup()</TT
> before doing anything else with the
sockets library.  The code to do that looks something like this:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;    #include &#60;winsock.h&#62;

    {
        WSADATA wsaData;   // if this doesn't work
        //WSAData wsaData; // then try this instead

        if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1, 1), &#38;wsaData) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "WSAStartup failed.\n");
            exit(1);
        } 
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>You also have to tell your compiler to link in the Winsock
library, usually called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>wsock32.lib</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>winsock32.lib</TT
> or somesuch.  Under VC++, this can be
done through the <TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>Project</TT
> menu, under
<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>Settings...</TT
>.  Click the
<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>Link</TT
> tab, and look for the box titled
"Object/library modules".  Add "wsock32.lib" to that list.</P
><P
>Or so I hear.</P
><P
>Finally, you need to call <TT
CLASS="function"
>WSACleanup()</TT
> when
you're all through with the sockets library.  See your online help for
details.</P
><P
>Once you do that, the rest of the examples in this tutorial should
generally apply, with a few exceptions.  For one thing, you can't use
<TT
CLASS="function"
>close()</TT
> to close a socket--you need to use
<TT
CLASS="function"
>closesocket()</TT
>, instead.  Also,
<TT
CLASS="function"
>select()</TT
> only works with socket descriptors, not
file descriptors (like <TT
CLASS="constant"
>0</TT
> for
<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>stdin</TT
>).</P
><P
>To get more information about Winsock, read the <A
HREF="http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/programming/winsock/"
TARGET="_top"
>Winsock FAQ</A
> and go from there.</P
><P
>Finally, I hear that Windows has no <TT
CLASS="function"
>fork()</TT
>
system call which is, unfortunately, used in some of my examples.  Maybe
you have to link in a POSIX library or something to get it to work, or
you can use <TT
CLASS="function"
>CreateProcess()</TT
> instead.
<TT
CLASS="function"
>fork()</TT
> takes no arguments, and
<TT
CLASS="function"
>CreateProcess()</TT
> takes about 48 billion arguments.

>I'm generally available to help out with email questions so feel
free to write in, but I can't guarantee a response.  I lead a pretty
busy life and there are times when I just can't answer a question you
have.  When that's the case, I usually just delete the message.  It's
nothing personal; I just won't ever have the time to give the detailed
answer you require.</P
><P
>As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond.  If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.</P
><P
>If not, hack on it some more, try to find the answer, and if it's
still elusive, then write me again with the information you've found and
hopefully it will be enough for me to help out.</P

I'd just like to let you know that I <EM

appreciate all the praise the guide has received over the years.  It's a
real morale boost, and it gladdens me to hear that it is being used for
good! <TT
