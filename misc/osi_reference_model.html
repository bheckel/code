The Application layer (7) (HTTP/SMTP/POP/FTP) communicates the received
                          information (such as files) to the user.

Presentation layer (6) e.g. encryption methods, character sets, etc.

The Session layer (5) e.g. warehouse managers talking on phone about how many
                           packages they want per day (slow up or speed up).
                           Gateways live here.

The Transport layer (4) (TCP/UDP) creates connections to the program on that
                        destination machine. e.g. shipping clerk in the 
                        warehouse sending mail to employees in 
                        different buildings

The Network layer (3) (IP) sends packets as far as the network segment
                      e.g. 203.24.13 (not down to the device number
                      203.24.13.84) using the Internet. 
                      Routers work at this level.
                      e.g. like a bad postal svc, mailman walks down Mill
                      Ridge with the package in his hand asking the
                      residents to see if it's for them b/c all he knows
                      to deliver to is a street address, not a house
                      address

The Data Link layer (2) (Ethernet/PPP) sends frames as far as the next hop.
                        Only understands the ethernet ip of
                        the host computer.
                        e.g. doesn't know what a street address 
                        is, only what a house address is, only
                        picks up mail from mailman with '7212'
                        on it.

The Physical layer (1) sends bits onto the wire at standard voltage, bits
                       per second, etc.

<H3 align=center>UNDERSTANDING THE OSI REFERENCE MODEL</H3>
<P>The OSI reference model describes modular building blocks of 
various functions that must be provided to have program to program 
communications between similar or dissimilar hosts. Each functional 
area describes certain tasks that must be performed by network 
hardware or software in order for these network communications to 
take place. Not all methods of network communication extend to all 
the layers of the full OSI reference model. For example, 
internetwork communications between programs on differing hosts 
using reliable TCP/IP communications might use all layers of the OSI 
model, while local Windows for Workgroups communications within the 
same network using the NetBEUI protocol might have communications 
occurring only at the Data Link Layer and Physical Layer levels. 
<P>One important thing to understand is that the OSI reference model 
describes what must transpire for <B>program to program 
communications</B> to occur between even dissimilar computer 
systems. Each layer is responsible to provide information and 
pointers to the next higher layer in the OSI model. The Application 
Layer (which is the highest layer in the OSI model) makes available 
network services to actual software application programs. 
<P>In describing the various functional areas of the OSI reference 
model, I will start from the bottom up. However, when we describe 
communications between two computer systems, we describe the 
communications beginning at one computer system at the highest layer 
that communications occur, going down through to the Physical Layer, 
through the transmission media and network, over to the other 
computer at the Physical Layer, then up through to the highest layer 
of communications on the other computer system. These communications 
are usually symmetrical. In the case of this type of communications 
occurring through a routed internetwork, the network portion of the 
diagram (between the OSI reference layers on each computer system), 
may also extend on through the Physical, Datalink, and to the 
Network Layer.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=262 alt="osi reference model communications" src="osicomm.gif" width=435 border=0> </CENTER>
<P>In the diagram above, the left stack of the OSI reference model 
represents computer number one, the middle two stacks indicate the 
actual routed internetwork, and the rightmost stack indicates 
computer number two. The arrows indicate the path taken by data sent 
from a program on computer number one to a program on computer 
number two, through the routed internetwork. 
<P>The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the <B>Physical 
Layer</B>. It is the foundation of communications between any 
computer systems. The Physical Layer specifies the transmission 
media, transmission devices, network structures, and the actual data 
signals across the transmission media. The transmission media 
provides the physical path through which data signals flow. The 
transmission media consists of either bound media (usually some type 
of cable) which have a central conductor of data signals surrounded 
by a physical outer jacket, or unbound media which rely on radio 
waves, microwaves, and infrared signaling. 
<P>In most LAN network communications, the Physical Layer describes 
some type of cabling system as the transmission media. The Physical 
Layer also describes the transmission devices that attach to the 
media, the physical connector specifications, and the electrical or 
optical signaling characteristics (analog or digital, signal levels, 
and signal encoding methods). The Physical Layer lastly describes 
the network topology, and how the Physical Layer transmission media 
is to be distributed (i.e., in a bus, star, ring, mesh, etc., 
topology). 
<P>The most simple type of communications between computer systems 
(serial or parallel) occurs at the Physical Layer, where the 
Physical Layer would consist of the transmission media, transmission 
devices, a simple point-to-point network structure, and network 
signaling and interface specifications (such as an RS-232 serial 
communications). 
<P>The second layer in the OSI reference model is the <B>Datalink 
Layer</B>. This layer describes the functions that must occur for 
LAN communications within a local network. The Datalink Layer 
provides the first level of organization of the data bits into a 
rudimentary structure called a Datalink frame. This frame is 
organized into fields of information that convey the beginning and 
ending of the frame, the address of the sender, the address of the 
receiver, a method to ensure that the frame does not contain errors 
that may have occurred in the course of being transmitted through 
the transmission media, and an area to provide some basic 
administrative function (such as flow control, frame length 
calculations, and protocol decisions). Datalink Layer flow control 
manages how much data the destination system can handle. 
<P>The Datalink Layer is broken into two logical areas, the <B>Media 
Access Control (MAC)</B> sublayer, and the <B>Logical Link Control 
(LLC)</B> Sublayer. The MAC sublayer refers to the Media Access 
Protocol (how do stations on a network gain access to the media and 
permission to transmit their data - contention, token passing, 
polling), and the physical addressing of stations on the network. 
This would include the Source and Destination address sections of 
the Datalink frame. The LLC sublayer includes portions of the 
Datalink frame administrative or control fields and CRC fields that 
are responsible for the frame synchronization, flow control, and 
error checking within the frame.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=244 
alt="Datalink Frame of the osi model" src="dlink.gif" width=435 border=0> </CENTER>
<P>The physical addressing at the Datalink layer (used for source 
and destination addressing in a Datalink Layer frame) is called a 
physical address because this address (also called a MAC-layer 
address) is hard coded into the network interface in their computer 
or workstation. This addressing is useful for conveying all the 
information necessary to direct information to and from stations 
within a local network. The addressing is usually assigned by the 
manufacturer of the network interface at the time of manufacture, 
and the first half of the address contains hex address information 
that is unique to each manufacturer. The last half of the MAC layer 
address is unique to that individual NIC card. Networks with 
duplicate addresses can have problem s in knowing where to properly 
deliver their data. This is why all manufacturers purchase unique 
identifiers and blocks of unique addresses for all the network 
interfaces that they manufacture. 
<P>When we refer to Ethernet, or Token Ring, or other LAN Networking 
systems (ARCNET, LocalTalk, FDDI, etc.), we are referring to the 
Physical and Datalink layer descriptions of these networks. For 
example, an Ethernet workstation will construct datalink layer 
frames that may conform to the IEEE 802.3 specification for Ethernet 
frames, and which follow that specifications requirements for 
signaling types, levels, media, physical connectors, etc. The 
Physical and Datalink Layers also specify the Media Access Control 
methodology (CSMA/CD), Ethernet topologies, and other rules 
necessary for ensuring a functional network design. The <B>Network 
Layer</B> is responsible for the internetworking process that needs 
to occur to reliably send and receive data between networks. It 
provides logical addressing at the Network Layer (as this addressing 
is usually specified in software, and is not hard coded into network 
interfaces as it is at the Datalink Layer), and provides for network 
routing, flow control, sequencing, and translation functions. 
Network Layer flow control monitors network connection. Network 
layer addressing provides addressing that is specific to the logical 
addressing assigned to a particular network protocol. For example, 
the Ethernet workstation described in the previous paragraph may 
have Ethernet as the Physical and Datalink layer network type, and 
may run both TCP/IP and Novell IPX/SPX as different network layer 
protocols. Each network layer protocol will have a different logical 
addressing scheme to enable communication between networks. 
<P>This brings up an interesting issue involving network protocols. 
Without going too deep into the subject, there are some common 
protocols used in LAN networking that do not extend to the network 
layer. These include DEC LAT, NetBIOS, NetBEUI, and others. Because 
they have no provisions for network layer addressing and routing, 
connecting these protocols between different LAN's must be done with 
MAC layer devices such as LAN bridges or LAN switches. Protocols 
that operate at the network layer (such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, DECNET, 
etc.) utilize routers to interconnect networks. Most routers have 
the ability to route routeable protocols and to bridge non-routeable 
traffic. 
<P>The <B>Transport Layer</B> provides reliable end-to-end 
communications by providing service addressing, flow control, 
datagram segmentation, and end-to-end error checking. The Transport 
layer is the second of three error checking levels in the OSI model 
(error checking occurs at the DataLink Layer, Transport, and Session 
Layer). While the Network Layer is responsible for transporting data 
from Network A to Network B, the transport layer ensures that 
packets arrives (or is reassembled) in one piece, and make sure that 
the data is directed to the appropriate service. While I have 
explained physical MAC-Layer addressing which occurs at the Datalink 
Layer, and the logical addressing at the network layer, we will now 
see that the Transport Layer concerns it self with the next layer of 
addressing described in the OSI model, which is Service Addressing. 
Service addressing identifies addresses or ports which point to 
upper layer network services. The transport level addressing also 
keeps track of multiple connections or conversations which might 
occur on a network attached computer system. It does this by 
tracking a connection identifier (connection ID, port, or socket), 
or by a transaction identifier (which would track each request, as 
opposed to tracking a conversation). The Transport Layer is also 
responsible for breaking larger units of data sent down from higher 
layers into smaller pieces that can be transported across the 
network. These pieces would then be reassembled at the Transport 
Layer of the receiving computer system and passed on to that 
computers higher layers. This is accomplished by assigning segment 
numbers to fragments of a common conversation. The Transport Layer 
accomplishes it's contribution to the flow control process by 
negotiating window sizes. 
<P>The <B>Session Layer</B> is responsible for connection 
establishment, data transfer, and for connection release. In this 
way the Session Layer provides mechanisms which establish, maintain, 
synchronize, and manage communications between computer systems. The 
Session layer is responsible for the establishment of connection ID 
numbers, and relies on the transport layer to provide the 
information which identifies the correct services. The Session Layer 
is responsible for the coordination of acknowledgement numbering and 
retransmission procedures. It tracks who initially initiated a 
conversation. Session layer is responsible for re-establishing a 
logical communications session between computers should that session 
be prematurely terminated (due to failure at a lower layer in the 
communications process). The Session layer would either resume the 
interrupted dialog, or initiates another new session to the other 
computer system. The Session Layer also manages planned connection 
release of a communications session. 
<P>The <B>Presentation Layer</B> is responsible for translating data 
into formats that can be readily understood by each computer system. 
The Presentation Layer concerns itself with translating differences 
at the bit level, byte level, or character level, and with file 
syntax. An example of this might be translating data formats between 
two different computer systems using the TCP/IP protocol, that have 
different data conventions. One host might use ASCII code and may 
have the left-most bit be the highest order bit (or most significant 
bit) in a byte of data, while the other host system utilizes EBCDIC 
and for which the left most bit is the lowest order bit (least 
significant bit). Computers need to agree the method of identifying 
how many bits equals a whole character and what file syntax is used 
by each system (file organization, beginning and ending boundaries, 
naming conventions, read and write access security, and file storage 
methods). The Presentation Layer also concerns itself with data 
compression and encryption. 
<P>Probably the most misunderstood layer of the OSI model is the 
<B>Application Layer</B>. Contrary to what many people think, this 
<B>IS NOT</B> the layer where the software application (such as your 
spreadsheet or word processing program) resides. It is the layer 
where network applications that facilitate network connectivity 
reside (file transfer/FTP, virtual terminal/Telnet, and electronic 
mail, for example), and where service advertisement and service 
availability are managed. Service Advertisement is the process of 
letting systems know which services are available on the network. 
Once it has been made advertised, it must be made available to the 
computers local operating system. 
<P>Network services include file services, print services, message 
services, application services, and database services. Network 
services are provided at the Application Layer. The Application 
Layer makes network services available to a computers local 
operating system. This is accomplished through Operating System call 
interception, remote operation, or via collaborative availability. 
In OS call interception, the local operating system is completely 
unaware of the existence of network services. In remote operation 
the local system is aware of the network, but the network server is 
unaware of the client. In collaborative systems, both the server and 
the client are aware of each other and work together to coordinate 
service availability. This method is typically used in peer-to-peer 
network operating systems. <BR><BR><BR><BR>
