Hi,

Please check the following list for any 45+ day old sessions belonging to you.
Unless you have kept an EGP session open for a very long time these are
probably the result of an old job failure.

They will be deleted in the next several days to save diskspace.  If thatâ€™s ok,
no reply is required.

Thanks!
