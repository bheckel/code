With all .o files copied to this dir, ran

$ ar r boblib.a *.o 
$ rm *.o
$ gcc Main.c libbobh.a     <---implicit linking

Same effect as ../

Now Main.c can use the functions in the object files.

Could have also copied libbobh.a to /usr/lib and compiled like so:

$ gcc Main.c -lbobh
or don't cp to /usr/lib and
$ gcc Main.c -L. -lbobh    <---to search pwd, '.'

Statically linked a.exe now has a *copy* of the .o files.
