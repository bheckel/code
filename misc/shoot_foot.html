          <p class="heading">How to shoot yourself in the foot with...</p>
          <p>C: You shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
          <p>C++: You accidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all in the
          foot. Providing emergency assistance is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise
          copies and which are just pointing at others and saying, "That's me, over here."</p>
          <p>FORTRAN-IV: You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes;
          then you shoot the sixth bullet anyway since no exception processing was anticipated.</p>
          <p>FORTRAN-77: You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes,
          then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you run out of bullets, you continue anyway
          because you still can't do exception-processing.</p>
          <p>Modula-2: You perform a shooting on what might be currently a foot with what might be
          currently a bullet shot by what might currently be a gun. After realizing that you can't
          accomplish anything in this language, you shoot yourself in the head.</p>
          <p>Modula-3: You can't shoot yourself in the foot, because it's BAD PROGRAMMING PRACTICE
          to have a foot. So you shoot yourself in the head instead (if someone, somewhere, has
          defined a method for head shooting).</p>
          <p>COBOL: Allocate $500000 for the project. USEing a COLT 45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at
          LEG.FOOT, THEN place ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER and SQUEEZE, THEN return HANDGUN
          to HOLDSTER. CHECK whether shoelace needs to be retied. Go for coffee break. Return in
          time to put foot under bullet.</p>
          <p>LISP: You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot
          yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the
          appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds
          ...</p>
          <p>scheme: You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot
          yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the
          appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds
          . . . but none of the other appendages are aware of this happening.</p>
          <p>BASIC: You shoot yourself in foot with water pistol. On big systems, continue until
          entire lower body is waterlogged.</p>
          <p>FORTH: Foot in yourself shoot. This takes about five bytes of memory, executes in two
          to ten clock cycles on any processor and can be used to replace any existing function of
          the language as well as in any future words. (Welcome to bottom up programming - where
          you, too, can perform compiler pre-processing instead of writing code). First you decide
          to leave the number of toes lost on the stack and then implement the word foot-toes@
          which takes three numbers from the stack: foot number, range, and projectile mass (in
          slugs) and changes the current vocabulary to 'blue'. While testing this word you are
          arrested by the police for mooning (remember, this is a bottom-up language) who
          demonstrate the far better top-down approach to damaging yourself.</p>
          <p>APL: You try to shoot yourself in the foot, then spend all day figuring out how to do
          it in fewer characters. You finally hear a gunshot, and there's a hole in your foot, but
          you don't remember enough linear algebra to understand what happened.</p>
          <p>Pascal: The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot, otherwise similar to
          Modula-2 except that the bullet is not the right type for the gun and your hand is blown
          off.</p>
          <p>SNOBOL: If you succeed, shoot yourself in the left foot. If you fail, shoot yourself
          in the right foot.</p>
          <p>Concurrent Euclid: You shoot yourself in somebody else's foot.</p>
          <p>HyperTalk: Put the first bullet of the gun into the left of leg of you. Answer the
          result.</p>
          <p>Motif: You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the trajectory, the
          bullet, and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles of the gun. When you finally
          get around to pulling the trigger, the gun jams.</p>
          <p>Unix: % Is foot.c foot.h foot.o toe.c toe.o % rm *.o rm: .o: No such file or directory
          % is % % make ShootFoot; make INSTALL</p>
          <p>DOS: You can't get to either foot from here. You finally work out how to shoot
          yourself in the foot, but can unshoot yourself with add-on software.</p>
          <p>OS/2: Point to Body and click, point to leg and click, point to lower leg and click,
          point to foot and gun goes click.</p>
          <p>Xbase: Shooting yourself is no problem. If you want to shoot yourself in the foot,
          you'll have to use Clipper.</p>
          <p>Paradox: Not only can you shoot yourself in the foot, your users can too.</p>
          <p>Revelation: You'll be able to shoot yourself in the foot, just as soon as you figure
          out what all these bullets are for.</p>
          <p>Visual Basic: You'll shoot yourself in the foot, but you'll have so much fun doing it
          that you don't care.</p>
          <p>Prolog: You tell your program you want to be shot in the foot. The program figures out
          how to do it, but the syntax doesn't allow it to explain. You attempt to shoot yourself
          in the foot, but the bullet, failing to find its mark, backtracks to the gun, which then
          explodes in your face.</p>
          <p>370 JCL: You send your foot down to MIS with a 4000-page document explaining how you
          want it to be shot. Three years later, your foot comes back deep-fried.</p>
          <p>Assembler: You try to shoot yourself in the foot only to discover you must first
          reinvent the gun, the bullet, and your foot. Using only 7 bytes of code. The bullet
          travels to your foot instantly, but it took you three weeks to load the round and aim the
          gun. By the time you've written the gun, you are dead, and don't have to worry about
          shooting your feet. You finally decide to shoot yourself in the foot with a laser, but
          only after bouncing it off a nearby satellite, and accidentally blow off your entire leg.
          Insodoing, you crash the OS and overwrite the root disk. The system administrator arrives
          and shoots you in the foot. After a moment of contemplation, the administrator shoots
          himself in the foot and then hops around the room rabidly shooting at everyone in
          sight.</p>
          <p>Apple System 7: Double click the gun icon and a window giving a selection for guns,
          target areas, plus balloon help with medical remedies, and assorted sound effects. Click
          "shoot" button and a small bomb appears with note "Error of Type 1 has occurred."</p>
          <p>Windows 3.0: You'd shoot yourself in the foot, but you die of old age between pulling
          the trigger and the gun going off. Then the gun self-destructs.</p>
          <p>Windows 3.1: Double click the gun icon and wait. Eventually a window opens giving a
          selection for guns, target areas, plus balloon help with medical remedies, and assorted
          sound effects. Click "shoot" button and a small box appears with note "Unable to open
          Shoot.dll, check that path is correct."</p>
          <p>Windows 95: Your gun is not compatible with this OS and you must buy an upgrade and
          install it before you can continue. Then you will be informed that you don't have enough
          memory.</p>
          <p>Windows NT: You shoot yourself in the foot, but only after a pretty animation of blood
          spurting all over the place.</p>
          <p>ML: You aim the gun, then supply it with a foot to shoot. If this is impossible,
          supply it with a phone directory, and let it hunt you down. Note that even if you are a
          centipede, it will *still only need one bullet*.</p>
          <p>ADA: Sorry, this gun is the wrong type for your foot. Please put your foot in front of
          this cannon instead. Thank you. Ada. If you are dumb enough to actually use this
          language, the United States Department of Defense will kidnap you, stand you up in front
          of a firing squad and tell the soldiers, "Shoot at the feet." After correctly packing
          your foot, they attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream, and
          confidently aim at your foot knowing it is safe. However the cordite in the round does an
          Unchecked Conversion, fires and shoots you in the foot anyway. Your executioners scour
          all 154e56 pages of the manuals, looking for references to "foot", "leg", or "toes"; then
          get hopelessly confused and give up. You escape and sneak in when the boss isn't around
          and actually write the stinkin' thing in C, and turn 7689 pages of source code in to the
          review committee, knowing that they'll never look at it. When the program needs
          maintenance, you resign.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Eiffel: You create a GUN object, two FOOT objects and a BULLET object. The GUN passes
          both the FOOT objects a reference to the BULLET. The FOOT objects increment their hole
          counts and forget about the BULLET. A little demon then drives a garbage truck over your
          feet and grabs the bullet (both of it) on the way.</p>
          <p>English You put your foot in your mouth, then bite it off.</p>
          <p>TeX: You shoot yourself in the foot, and the remains get *really neatly* arranged over
          the floor (even if you don't want them to be).</p>
          <p>LaTeX: Your foot still gets neatly arranged, and it takes you less time to aim, but
          somehow that bit of bone isn't quite right.</p>
          <p>Smalltalk: Please come back when you've told the bullets how to fly. Ah, thank you.
          *BANG* You send the message shoot to gun, with selectors bullet and myFoot. A window pops
          up saying Gunpowder doesNotUnderstand: spark. After several fruitless hours spent
          browsing the methods for Trigger, FiringPin and IdealGas, you take the easy way out and
          create ShotFoot, a subclass of Foot with an additional instance variable bulletHole. You
          spend so much time playing with the graphics and windowing system that your boss shoots
          you in the foot, takes away your workstation, and makes you develop in COBOL on a
          character terminal.</p>
          <p>PVM: Okay, how many toes do we have? Okay you all ready? Sure? Okay, okay, wait for
          it... *BANG* (The toes are shot off in parallel, but they only hurt one at a time).</p>
          <p>HTML: Look at this really pretty gun. Now, if you'll just click &lt;A
          HREF="http://foot.html"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;...You shoot yourself in the foot, only to find
          out that no matter how gory the result looks, your foot keeps working. Your foot finally
          stops working when you stub your toe kicking the box the gun came in.</p>
          <p>Java: You can't shoot yourself in the foot. There must be a virtual foot around here
          somewhere, though...You decide can do it with a standalone interpreter, but a java applet
          will not let you access your foot. You finally write an applet to shoot yourself in the
          foot and put it on the Internet. People all over the world shoot themselves in the foot,
          but their foot can't figure out what the bullets are and ignores them.</p>
          <p>PostScript: Hang on, there was a gun I defined a while ago, and it looked *really*
          nice...</p>
          <p>PL/I: You consume all available system resources, including all the offline bullets.
          The Data Processing &amp; Payroll Department doubles its size, triples its budget,
          acquires four new mainframes, and drops the original one on your foot.</p>
          <p>Algol: You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket is aesthetically
          fascinating, and the wound baffles the adolescent medic in the emergency room.</p>
          <p>Algol 60 You spend hours trying to figure out how to fire the gun since it doesn't
          have any provision for input or output.</p>
          <p>Algol 68 You mildly deprocedure the gun, the bullet gets firmly dereferenced, and your
          foot is strongly coerced to void.</p>
          <p>csh: You can't remember the syntax for anything, so you spend five hours reading man
          pages before giving up. You then shoot the computer and switch to C.</p>
          <p>dBase: You buy a gun. Bullets are only available from another company and are promised
          to work so you buy them. Then you find out that the next version of the gun is the one
          that is scheduled to actually shoot bullets. When you get them, you squeeze the trigger,
          but the bullet moves so slowly that by the time your foot feels the pain, you've
          forgotten why you shot yourself anyway.</p>
          <p>dBase IV, V1.0: You pull the trigger, but it turns out that the gun was a poorly
          designed hand grenade and the whole building blows up.</p>
          <p>SQL: You cut your foot off, send it out to a service bureau and when it returns, it
          has a hole in it but will no longer fit the attachment at the end of your leg. Insert
          into Foot; Select Bullet From Gun.Hand;Where Chamber = 'LOADED' And Trigger =
          'PULLED'</p>
          <p>Clipper: You grab a bullet, get ready to insert it in the gun so that you can shoot
          yourself in the foot and discover that the gun that the bullets fits has not yet been
          built, but should be arriving in the mail _REAL_SOON_NOW_.</p>
          <p>Oracle: The menus for coding foot_shooting have not been implemented yet and you can't
          do foot shooting in SQL. ORACLE sells you a gun, a box of bullets, a holster, a cardboard
          mock-up of a wild-west town, and a stetson. You find the trigger, which takes 27 people
          to pull. ORACLE provides 26 consultants, all with holsters, cardboard mock-ups, and
          stetsons. The bullet doesn't leave the gun barrel and you hire four more ORACLE
          consultants to optimise. The bullet bounces off of your sandals. You buy a shoulder
          holster solution, and relational titanium alloy bullets, and body armour infrastructure,
          and a laser sight assistant, and a retractable arm stock application, and an enterprise
          team of ballistics experts and a chiropodist. The bullet still won't go in. You decide to
          buy INGRES. Richard Donkin shoots you in the foot.</p>
          <p>Access: You try to point the gun at your foot, but it shoots holes in all your Borland
          distribution diskettes instead.</p>
          <p>BASIC (compiled): You shoot yourself in the foot with a BB using a SCUD missile
          launcher.</p>
          <p>PHP: If you're lucky and the HTTP connection doesn't time out, you shoot yourself in
          the foot.</p>
          <p>BCPL: You shoot yourself somewhere in the leg -- you can't get any finer resolution
          than that.</p>
          <p>Powerbuilder: While attempting to load the gun you discover that the LoadGun system
          function is buggy; as a work around you tape the bullet to the outside of the gun and
          unsuccessfully attempt to fire it with a nail. In frustration you club your foot with the
          butt of the gun and explain to your client that this approximates the functionality of
          shooting yourself in the foot and that the next version of Powerbuilder will fix it.</p>
          <p>Standard ML: By the time you get your code to typecheck, you're using a shoot to foot
          yourself in the gun.</p>
          <p>MUMPS: You shoot 583149 AK-47 teflon-tipped, hollow-point, armour-piercing bullets
          into even-numbered toes on odd-numbered feet of everyone in the building -- with one line
          of code. Three weeks later you shoot yourself in the head rather than try to modify that
          line.</p>
          <p>DOS JCL: You first find the building you're in in the phone book, then find your
          office number in the corporate phone book. Then you have to write this down, then
          describe, in cubits, your exact location, in relation to the door (right hand side
          thereof). Then you need to write down the location of the gun (loading it is a
          proprietary utility), then you load it, and the COBOL program, and run them, and, with
          luck, it may be run tonight.</p>

          <p>CP/M: I remember when shooting yourself in the foot with a BB gun was a big deal.</p>
          <p>DOS: You finally found the gun, but can't locate the file with the foot for the life
          of you.</p>
          <p>FlagShip: Starting at the top of your head, you aim the gun at yourself repeatedly
          until, half an hour later, the gun is finally pointing at your foot and you pull the
          trigger. A new foot with a hole in it appears but you can't work out how to get rid of
          the old one and your gun doesn't work anymore.</p>
          <p>FidoNet: You put your foot in your mouth, then echo it internationally.</p>
          <p>PicoSpan: You can't shoot yourself in the foot because you're not a host. Whenever you
          shoot yourself in the foot, someone opens a topic in policy about it.</p>
          <p>Internet: You put your foot in your mouth, shoot it, then spam the bullet so that
          everybody gets shot in the foot.</p>

          <p>Genetic Algorithms: You create 10,000 strings describing the best way to shoot
          yourself in the foot. By the time the program produces the optimal solution, humans have
          evolved wings and the problem is moot.</p>
          <p>COMAL: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol, but the bore is
          clogged, and the pressure build-up blows apart both the pistol and your hand.</p>
          <p>INFORMIX: The first gun doesn't work. Three months later INFORMIX's support desk sends
          another gun which doesn't match the version number of the bullets. INFORMIX suggests you
          upgrade to INFORMIX-ONLINE. You pull the trigger and your shoe gets wet.</p>
          <p>INGRES: You pull the trigger, and your identical twin in San Francisco gets shot. You
          then turn off distributed query optimization.</p>
          <p>SYBASE: You carelessly invoke the procedure sp_insert_bullet() which fires a trigger
          (neah, eh?) on the table GUN. To maintain referential integrity, the system invokes
          another trigger which inserts bullets in your other foot, your shins, your thighs, and so
          on up to the cranium. You are left in third normal form.</p>
          <p>OCCAM: You send a message to your finger, which sends a message to the trigger, which
          sends a message to the firing pin, which sends a message to the primer, which sends a
          message to the firing charge, which sends a message to the bullet, which sends a very
          unpleasant message to your foot. The pipeline continues to run, a hail of bullets
          emerging from the output channel and drilling their way via your foot to the center of
          the earth. The high velocity arrival of such stupendous amounts of lead creates a a
          density shockwave which eventually collapses beyond its own event horizon. The black hole
          thus formed goes on to absorb the Earth, most of the minor planets, and the Sun. The
          problems of your foot become increasingly insignificant during this process.
          Hyperintelligent beings from the planet Zorg nod their several heads wisely and confide
          to each other: "I always said Tony was a complete twit."</p>
          <p>RTL: You start to really shoot yourself in the foot, but 6 slugs is too many for an
          array and blows the compiler to pieces. Eventually you realize you must rebuild the
          compiler to allow such huge arrays. This is so stupid and boring that you start to shoot
          yourself, but just in time you are interrupted by ...</p>
          <p>POP11: Your boss has never heard of it and wants you to use one of C, C++, Lisp, or
          Prolog, so you push his foot onto the stack and shoot it.</p>
          <p>Cray: I knew you were going to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
          <p>Apple: We'll let you shoot yourself, but it'll cost you a bundle.</p>
          <p>Arc Macro Language: You create a gun polygon and a bullet polygon. &amp;Then &amp;you
          &amp;realize &amp;that &amp;your &amp;foot &amp;is &amp;in &amp;another UTM &amp;zone</p>
          <p>Hewlett-Packard: You can use this machine-gun to shoot yourself in the foot, but the
          firing pin is broken.</p>
          <p>IBM: You insert a clip into the gun, wait half an hour, and it goes off in random
          directions. If a bullet hits your foot, you're lucky.</p>
          <p>Microsoft: Object "Foot" will be included in the next release. You can upgrade for
          $500, and it will be the "best Foot ever." You can shoot yourself in the foot, but the
          method is buried in the docs somewhere</p>
          <p>NeXT: We don't sell guns anymore, just ammunition.</p>
          <p>Objective C: You write a protocol for shooting yourself in the foot so that all people
          can get shot in their feet.</p>
          <p>COM: You create an instance of your foot, the gun and a bullet. You realise the bullet
          is the wrong calibre and wont fit properly in the IChamber, and that your foot is not
          registered.</p>
          <p>ActiveX: {AAGUN-06A3-SH00T-8F98-F00TB92EB7}</p>
          <p>C#: You write about 100 lines of code to print "Hello, world!" in a dialogue box, only
          to have a UAE pop up when you click on OK. This shuts down the program manager, leaving
          you nothing but a screensaver. You then fly to Washington and shoot Bill Gates in the
          foot.</p>
          <p>LOGO: You tell a turtle to draw a picture of a foot and a gun, then shoot the turtle.
          You can easily shoot the gun, but first you have to work out the geometry to be sure the
          bullet goes into your foot.</p>
          <p>INTERCAL: You ask the compiler to please load the gun and do place your foot in the
          trajectory of the bullet, but the compiler gives up.</p>
          <p>MS Visual C++: Instatiate an object of the CShootOwnFoot class. This will shoot your
          foot just fine as long as you have your own Microsoft Revolver(tm)- check your system
          directory for msrlvr32.dll. Note (by dah) that to run msrlvr32.dll you will have to
          download Internet Explorer 4.0 first, although you may continue to use any browser. The
          service pack 3-A, which must be installed over service pack 2 unless service pack 1 was
          installed, is available for download also. Finally, you should exit all applications and
          back up your registry before attempting to shoot yourself in the foot. After shooting
          your foot, you will need the Win95 CDROM and have to reboot your system. Note that the
          FootChute service for Win95 will only shoot little toes. To shoot entire feet, you will
          need the FootEnterprise package which runs only on NT Server, available separately.
          Pay-by-call help is available in the case of a stuck or jammed msrlvr32.dll Note:
          knowledge base article 345 is available to Premier Subscribers which discusses problems
          some customers have had distinguishing the "muzzle" from the "handle", symptoms of which
          include failure to damage your foot and occasional holes to hardware systems in the
          immediate area, despite apparently correct functioning of the dll. The spurious holes
          apparently do not recurr once the muzzle/handle swap has been made.</p>
          <p>6502 You shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
          <p>68000 You can't decide which gun and which bullet to use, so you hang yourself.</p>
          <p>8080 You foot yourself in the shoot.</p>
          <p>80x86 The gun isn't in the same segment as your feet, so you can't shoot them.</p>
          <p>ASP You try to shoot yourself in the foot, however the most advanced thing you can
          manage is to cut your wrist. Lacking a gun, you hold the bullet in your hand and throw it
          at your foot....and miss. You pick it back up, squeeze the trigger, but somebody
          corrupted the index and the bullet shoots in your eye. You try again, but this time the
          bullet moves so slowly that by the time your foot feels the pain you've forgotten why you
          shot yourself anyway.</p>

          <p>MED-PC: You can't shoot yourself in the foot, but you can train a pigeon to pull the
          trigger.</p>
          <p>MOO: You ask a wizard for a pair of hands. After lovingly handcrafting the gun and
          each bullet, you tell everyone that you've shot yourself in the foot.</p>
          <p>Nedula/2: After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything in this
          language, you shoot yourself in the head.</p>
          <p>Objective-C: You write a protocol for shooting yourself in the foot so that all people
          can get shot in their feet.</p>
          <p>ORCA/C: Byteworks keeps promising to supply good ammunition REAL SOON NOW.</p>
          <p>PL/1: After consuming all system resources including bullets, the data processing
          department doubles its size, acquires two new mainframes and drops the original on your
          foot.</p>
          <p>SAS: You spend three hours trying to cut your way through your foot with a rock flake,
          only to realize that the language was invented before guns allowed you to shoot yourself
          in the foot interactively in one easy step with no programming. You have no idea that the
          gun, the bullet, or your foot exists. The gun is locked in a safe in a bank vault on the
          other side of the galaxy, the bullet is locked in a safe in a bank vault in another
          galaxy, and the people who know the combinations for the safes and bank vaults died ten
          million years ago. Still, the gun goes off and fires the bullet through your foot.</p>
          <p>WorldBuilder: You can't shoot yourself in the foot, but you can shoot the feet of
          plenty of monsters.</p>
          <p>Z: You write out all the specifications of your foot, the bullet, the gun, and the
          relevant laws of physics, but all you can do is prove that you can shoot yourself in the
          foot.</p>
          <p>Tcl/Tk: You write 10,000 lines of C code to shoot yourself in the foot, then write a
          nice interface so other people can shoot themselves in the foot in exactly the same way
          with less trouble.</p>
          <p>Python: You insert the bullet into the gun but because there were actually TAB
          characters in the barrel instead of spaces, the gun jams with an IndentError. After
          unblocking the whitespace jam, you try to load the bullet into the gun, but Guido pulls
          it away from you and gives you version 2.0. You finally fire the gun, but the bullet
          travels so slowly towards your foot that you get tired and leave.</p>
          <p>Brainf*ck: You create a Turing complete gun, but it takes more bytes of memory to
          store the gun than there are protons in the universe. The universe dies of old age before
          you finish writing the bullet.</p>
          <p>PERL: You pick up a swiss army machine gun and begin to load it. The gun and your foot
          begin to grow to huge proportions and the world around you slows down, until the gun
          fires. It makes a tiny hole, which you don't feel. Deciding to improve on this, you post
          a query to comp.lang.perl.misc to determine the optimal approach. After sifting through
          500 replies (which you accomplish with a short perl script), not to mention the
          cross-posts to the perl5-porters mailing list (for which you upgraded your first sifter
          into a package, which of course you uploaded to CPAN for others who might have a similar
          problem, which, of course, is the problem of sorting out email and news, not the problem
          of shooting yourself in the foot), you set to the task of simply and elegantly shooting
          yourself in the foot, until you discover that, while it works fine in most cases, NT,
          VMS, and various flavors of Linux, AIX, and Irix all shoot you in the foot sooner than
          your perl script could. You finally settle on<br>
           s/toes/blood/g for @toes;<br>
           and shoot yourself in the foot. You then decide it was so much fun that you invent
          another six completely different ways to do it. In one of these, you separate the bullet
          from the gun with a hyperoptimized regexp, and then you transport it to your foot using
          an array of arrays of arrays. However, the program fails to run and you can't see the gun
          anymore. Eventually, you realise that what you really needed all along was the Gun::Foot
          module off of CPAN.</p>
