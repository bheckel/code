   Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL
CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution
into the NEXUS phase -- a being
virtually identical to a human -- known
as a replicant.  The NEXUS 6 Replicants
were superior in strength and agility,
and at least equal in intelligence, to
the genetic engineers who created them.
Replicants were used Off-world as slave
labor, in the hazardous exploration and
colonization of other planets.

   After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6
combat team in an Off-world colony,
they were declared illegal on
earth -- under penalty of death.
Special police squads -- BLADE RUNNER
UNITS -- had orders to shoot to kill,
upon detection, any trespassing
Replicants.

This was not called execution.

It was called retirement.
